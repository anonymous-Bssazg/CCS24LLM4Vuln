            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nA malicious user can brick minting, burning and harvesting of liquidity for almost all liquidity providers.\n\nImportant NOTE: This is a different vector from another gas issue, which is iterating over too many ticks in `(int24 i = lowerTick + 10; i <= upperTick - 10; ++i)`. That issue affects wide liquidity positions, while this attack vector affects even liquidity positions with a relatively small number of ticks.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called, under most conditions, for every potentially eligible tick, it will iterate over every `tickTrackingData` in `tickTracking`:\n\n```solidity\nwhile (time < block.timestamp && tickTrackingIndex < numTickTracking)\n```\n\n`tickTracking` is iterated by `tickTrackingIndex++;`\n\nThe array mapped by `tickTracking_` is increased by 1 for a tick every time a trade through the liquidity pool changes the price from a different tick to this tick. This is implemented in the `crossTicks` function:\n\n```solidity\n    function crossTicks(\n        bytes32 poolIdx,\n        int24 exitTick,\n        int24 entryTick\n    ) internal {\n        uint256 numElementsExit = tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick].length;\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick][numElementsExit - 1]\n            .exitTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);\n        StorageLayout.TickTracking memory tickTrackingData = StorageLayout\n            .TickTracking(uint32(block.timestamp), 0);\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][entryTick].push(tickTrackingData);\n    }\n```\nA user could purposely increase the length of the `tickTracking_` array and hence cause the gas limit to be reached whenever the array is looped over.\n\nThe price impact required to cross a tick is from 0 to 1 bps, as 1 bps as the tick width. This is already extremely small, but the attacker could have the swap amount be a very small fraction of a bps if they first swap to make the price end very close to a tick boundary, and then execute multiple extremely small swaps which bounce the price back and forth over the tick boundary.\n\nNote that the CANTO liquidity rewards are targeted to stable pools. An attacker can be quite confident, for example, that a USDC/USDT pool will trade at around \\$1, and the ticks closest to \\$1 will always be eligible for rewards and therefore be looped over by all rewardable positions when `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called. Therefore the attack can be targeted to just one or two ticks to affect almost every user.\n\n`accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called during minting, burning and harvesting liquidity positions. Therefore this gas griefing attack will make all these functions revert, for almost every user. This would basically break the functionality of concentrated liquidity pools on Ambient. \n\nContrast the effect to the cost to the attacker: using the aforementioned attack vector the main cost to the attacker will be the gas costs of performing the swaps. This is far lower than the damage that is done to the protocol/users\n\nOne additional factor which makes this attack easy to execute that crossing ticks even if the entry and exit is within the same `block.timestamp` adds to the array length. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero. \n\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nOne immediate step would to `pop()` tickTrackingData as soon as the exitTimestamp == entryTimestamp. This happens to the last element of the array when `crossTicks` is called. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero.\n\nThe documentation stated that CANTO rewards are meant to be distributed for stable pools for this codebase. The term \"stable\" could have different interpretations, but this reccomendation assumes that this refers to stablecoin-like or pegged asset pairs such as stETH/WETH, USDT/USDC etc.\n\nInstead of iterating through every tick, one could assume a range where the stable assets could lie and then reward all positions that lie within the specified range - in this case +- 10 ticks of the price tick. \n\nThis makes an assumption that these \"stable assets\" will actually stay pegged to each other. However, the current accounting architecture has multiple problems:\n\n- Given the high number of loops required by the current accounting mechanism, there are multiple reasons that gas could run out. This includes iterating through too many ticks or having too many tick entries/exits\n\n- The current mechanism increases the gas costs of all minting, burning and harvesting\n\n- DOS attacks like the one described in this issue are possible.\n\nAssuming a stable price has the downside of misallocating rewards if the stable assets depeg from each other. However, this may be a reasonable tradeoff to prevent this DOS attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nDoS"

Due to division truncation in Solidity, rewards calculation can result in zero when multiplying `accumulator` by `ACC_TOKEN_PRECISION` and then dividing by a large `totalSharesStaked`. This can lead to users not receiving rewards they are entitled to. A pattern with an oversized `BASE_DIVISOR` leads to such a large `totalSharesStaked` that it causes the precision loss. Adjusting the values of `ACC_TOKEN_PRECISION` and `BASE_DIVISOR` could mitigate the issue.",

This allows an attacker to mint a small amount of liquidity and then burn it to claim all the accumulated fees in the range, even those attributable to others who provided more liquidity. To mitigate this, the report suggests changing the fee distribution mechanism to ensure that fees are calculated and distributed based on the liquidity provider's share, rather than being sent to whoever burns liquidity.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nA malicious user can brick minting, burning and harvesting of liquidity for almost all liquidity providers.\n\nImportant NOTE: This is a different vector from another gas issue, which is iterating over too many ticks in `(int24 i = lowerTick + 10; i <= upperTick - 10; ++i)`. That issue affects wide liquidity positions, while this attack vector affects even liquidity positions with a relatively small number of ticks.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called, under most conditions, for every potentially eligible tick, it will iterate over every `tickTrackingData` in `tickTracking`:\n\n```solidity\nwhile (time < block.timestamp && tickTrackingIndex < numTickTracking)\n```\n\n`tickTracking` is iterated by `tickTrackingIndex++;`\n\nThe array mapped by `tickTracking_` is increased by 1 for a tick every time a trade through the liquidity pool changes the price from a different tick to this tick. This is implemented in the `crossTicks` function:\n\n```solidity\n    function crossTicks(\n        bytes32 poolIdx,\n        int24 exitTick,\n        int24 entryTick\n    ) internal {\n        uint256 numElementsExit = tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick].length;\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick][numElementsExit - 1]\n            .exitTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);\n        StorageLayout.TickTracking memory tickTrackingData = StorageLayout\n            .TickTracking(uint32(block.timestamp), 0);\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][entryTick].push(tickTrackingData);\n    }\n```\nA user could purposely increase the length of the `tickTracking_` array and hence cause the gas limit to be reached whenever the array is looped over.\n\nThe price impact required to cross a tick is from 0 to 1 bps, as 1 bps as the tick width. This is already extremely small, but the attacker could have the swap amount be a very small fraction of a bps if they first swap to make the price end very close to a tick boundary, and then execute multiple extremely small swaps which bounce the price back and forth over the tick boundary.\n\nNote that the CANTO liquidity rewards are targeted to stable pools. An attacker can be quite confident, for example, that a USDC/USDT pool will trade at around \\$1, and the ticks closest to \\$1 will always be eligible for rewards and therefore be looped over by all rewardable positions when `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called. Therefore the attack can be targeted to just one or two ticks to affect almost every user.\n\n`accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called during minting, burning and harvesting liquidity positions. Therefore this gas griefing attack will make all these functions revert, for almost every user. This would basically break the functionality of concentrated liquidity pools on Ambient. \n\nContrast the effect to the cost to the attacker: using the aforementioned attack vector the main cost to the attacker will be the gas costs of performing the swaps. This is far lower than the damage that is done to the protocol/users\n\nOne additional factor which makes this attack easy to execute that crossing ticks even if the entry and exit is within the same `block.timestamp` adds to the array length. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero. \n\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nOne immediate step would to `pop()` tickTrackingData as soon as the exitTimestamp == entryTimestamp. This happens to the last element of the array when `crossTicks` is called. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero.\n\nThe documentation stated that CANTO rewards are meant to be distributed for stable pools for this codebase. The term \"stable\" could have different interpretations, but this reccomendation assumes that this refers to stablecoin-like or pegged asset pairs such as stETH/WETH, USDT/USDC etc.\n\nInstead of iterating through every tick, one could assume a range where the stable assets could lie and then reward all positions that lie within the specified range - in this case +- 10 ticks of the price tick. \n\nThis makes an assumption that these \"stable assets\" will actually stay pegged to each other. However, the current accounting architecture has multiple problems:\n\n- Given the high number of loops required by the current accounting mechanism, there are multiple reasons that gas could run out. This includes iterating through too many ticks or having too many tick entries/exits\n\n- The current mechanism increases the gas costs of all minting, burning and harvesting\n\n- DOS attacks like the one described in this issue are possible.\n\nAssuming a stable price has the downside of misallocating rewards if the stable assets depeg from each other. However, this may be a reasonable tradeoff to prevent this DOS attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nDoS"
