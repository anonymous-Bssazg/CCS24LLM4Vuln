There is no balance validation for `depositGivenInputAmount()` and `withdrawGivenOutputAmount()` functions, which use `_reserveTokenSpecified()` function.\n\n## Impact\nIf there's no other validation outside these two functions, user deposits/withdraws may break the invariant, i.e. the pool's ratio of y to x is outside the interval `[MIN_M, MAX_M)`.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAdd the following code in test/EvolvingProteusProperties.t.sol file EvolvingProteusProperties contract, and run `forge test --mt RatioOutsideExpectedInterval`.\n\n```js\nfunction testDepositRatioOutsideExpectedInterval(uint256 x0, uint256 y0, uint256 s0, uint256 depositedAmount) public {\n  int128 MIN_M = 0x00000000000002af31dc461;\n  uint256 INT_MAX_SQRT = 0xb504f333f9de6484597d89b3754abe9f;\n\n  vm.assume(x0 >= MIN_BALANCE && x0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(y0 >= MIN_BALANCE && y0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(s0 >= MIN_BALANCE && s0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(depositedAmount >= MIN_OPERATING_AMOUNT && depositedAmount < INT_MAX_SQRT && depositedAmount >= 2 * uint256(FIXED_FEE));\n  vm.assume(y0/x0 <= MAX_BALANCE_AMOUNT_RATIO);\n  vm.assume(x0/y0 <= MAX_BALANCE_AMOUNT_RATIO);\n  vm.assume(int256(y0).divi(int256(x0) + int256(depositedAmount)) < MIN_M);   // breaks the invariant\n  SpecifiedToken depositedToken = SpecifiedToken.X;\n  \n  vm.expectRevert();  // There should be at least one case that call did not revert as expected\n  DUT.depositGivenInputAmount(\n      x0,\n      y0,\n      s0,\n      depositedAmount,\n      depositedToken\n  );\n}\n\nfunction testWithdrawRatioOutsideExpectedInterval(uint256 x0, uint256 y0, uint256 s0, uint256 withdrawnAmount) public {\n  int128 MIN_M = 0x00000000000002af31dc461;\n  uint256 INT_MAX_SQRT = 0xb504f333f9de6484597d89b3754abe9f;\n\n  vm.assume(x0 >= MIN_BALANCE && x0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(y0 >= MIN_BALANCE && y0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(s0 >= MIN_BALANCE && s0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(withdrawnAmount >= MIN_OPERATING_AMOUNT && withdrawnAmount < INT_MAX_SQRT && withdrawnAmount >= 2 * uint256(FIXED_FEE));\n  vm.assume(y0/x0 <= MAX_BALANCE_AMOUNT_RATIO);\n  vm.assume(x0/y0 <= MAX_BALANCE_AMOUNT_RATIO);\n  vm.assume(withdrawnAmount < y0);    // no more than balance\n  vm.assume((int256(y0) - int256(withdrawnAmount)).divi(int256(x0)) < MIN_M);   // breaks the invariant\n  SpecifiedToken withdrawnToken = SpecifiedToken.Y;\n  \n  vm.expectRevert();  // There should be at least one case that call did not revert as expected\n  DUT.withdrawGivenOutputAmount(\n      x0,\n      y0,\n      s0,\n      withdrawnAmount,\n      withdrawnToken\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIt's recommended to add `_checkBalances(xi + specifiedAmount, yi)` after  and add `_checkBalances(xi, yi + specifiedAmount)` after .\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation"

                    "description": "The vulnerability described in the report outlines an economic or logical flaw rather than a traditional bug like a buffer overflow or reentrancy. Specifically, the problem lies in inequitable token distribution when liquidity is added to the pool. The provided code calculates the amount of LP (liquidity provider) tokens to be minted based on the smaller proportion of the two deposited token amounts. If a liquidity provider deposits tokens in a ratio different from the current pool ratio, they end up with an imbalance: excess of one token remains in the pool, which they cannot reclaim proportionally upon removal of liquidity.\n\nThe excess tokens, in essence, become a donation to the pool and benefit the other liquidity providers. The vulnerability stems from the smart contract's failure to:\n\n1. Account for discrepancies in the desired contribution ratios versus the pool's existing ratios when adding liquidity.\n2. Ensure that the liquidity provider can retrieve their deposited value in full upon removal (subject to transactional losses like trading fees).\n\nThe `testLockOfFunds_AUDIT` function in the report demonstrates this issue by showing that a liquidity provider (Bob) receives fewer USD tokens than he deposited after removing his liquidity, despite setting - and receiving - the minimum LP tokens he specified.\n\nThe recommended mitigation step is to improve the `add` function. The smart contract should calculate the optimal amounts of tokens to be added to the pool based on the current reserves, the amounts specified by the user, and the minimum LP token amount that the user is willing to accept, much in the same way that the Uniswap V2 Router does. This would prevent the unintentional donation of tokens to the pool and ensure a fair distribution when adding and removing liquidity.\n\nTo better evaluate the code and propose an appropriate fix, calling the `add` function and other related functions (like adjusting slippage, fees, or managing reserves) would likely be necessary. Without seeing these additional functions in the contract, it is challenging to provide explicit fixes, but the general approach would be to improve the token ratio alignment during liquidity provision.",

The function fails to adequately determine the optimal amount of LP tokens to mint when liquidity is added in disproportional amounts, which can result in liquidity providers not receiving a fair representation of their contribution to the pool, effectively 'donating' the excess to the pool. The mitigation strategy involves adding functionality to calculate optimal token amounts when adding liquidity, similar to the methodology in Uniswap V2 Router.",

The scenario provided indicates that when liquidity is added with an imbalanced token ratio, the excess tokens are locked and not redeemable, creating potential for exploitative arbitrage. While the '_reserveTokenSpecified' function computes token amounts during liquidity provision, it does not address the actual liquidity addition process where the flaw occurs. Without seeing the complete code, including the 'add' function that interacts with '_reserveTokenSpecified', the extent of the vulnerability can't be fully assessed, but the report provides sufficient information to confirm the presence of the issue as described.",
