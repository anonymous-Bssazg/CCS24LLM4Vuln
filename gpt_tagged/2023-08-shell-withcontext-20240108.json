There is no balance validation for `depositGivenInputAmount()` and `withdrawGivenOutputAmount()` functions, which use `_reserveTokenSpecified()` function.\n\n## Impact\nIf there's no other validation outside these two functions, user deposits/withdraws may break the invariant, i.e. the pool's ratio of y to x is outside the interval `[MIN_M, MAX_M)`.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAdd the following code in test/EvolvingProteusProperties.t.sol file EvolvingProteusProperties contract, and run `forge test --mt RatioOutsideExpectedInterval`.\n\n```js\nfunction testDepositRatioOutsideExpectedInterval(uint256 x0, uint256 y0, uint256 s0, uint256 depositedAmount) public {\n  int128 MIN_M = 0x00000000000002af31dc461;\n  uint256 INT_MAX_SQRT = 0xb504f333f9de6484597d89b3754abe9f;\n\n  vm.assume(x0 >= MIN_BALANCE && x0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(y0 >= MIN_BALANCE && y0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(s0 >= MIN_BALANCE && s0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(depositedAmount >= MIN_OPERATING_AMOUNT && depositedAmount < INT_MAX_SQRT && depositedAmount >= 2 * uint256(FIXED_FEE));\n  vm.assume(y0/x0 <= MAX_BALANCE_AMOUNT_RATIO);\n  vm.assume(x0/y0 <= MAX_BALANCE_AMOUNT_RATIO);\n  vm.assume(int256(y0).divi(int256(x0) + int256(depositedAmount)) < MIN_M);   // breaks the invariant\n  SpecifiedToken depositedToken = SpecifiedToken.X;\n  \n  vm.expectRevert();  // There should be at least one case that call did not revert as expected\n  DUT.depositGivenInputAmount(\n      x0,\n      y0,\n      s0,\n      depositedAmount,\n      depositedToken\n  );\n}\n\nfunction testWithdrawRatioOutsideExpectedInterval(uint256 x0, uint256 y0, uint256 s0, uint256 withdrawnAmount) public {\n  int128 MIN_M = 0x00000000000002af31dc461;\n  uint256 INT_MAX_SQRT = 0xb504f333f9de6484597d89b3754abe9f;\n\n  vm.assume(x0 >= MIN_BALANCE && x0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(y0 >= MIN_BALANCE && y0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(s0 >= MIN_BALANCE && s0 <= INT_MAX_SQRT);\n  vm.assume(withdrawnAmount >= MIN_OPERATING_AMOUNT && withdrawnAmount < INT_MAX_SQRT && withdrawnAmount >= 2 * uint256(FIXED_FEE));\n  vm.assume(y0/x0 <= MAX_BALANCE_AMOUNT_RATIO);\n  vm.assume(x0/y0 <= MAX_BALANCE_AMOUNT_RATIO);\n  vm.assume(withdrawnAmount < y0);    // no more than balance\n  vm.assume((int256(y0) - int256(withdrawnAmount)).divi(int256(x0)) < MIN_M);   // breaks the invariant\n  SpecifiedToken withdrawnToken = SpecifiedToken.Y;\n  \n  vm.expectRevert();  // There should be at least one case that call did not revert as expected\n  DUT.withdrawGivenOutputAmount(\n      x0,\n      y0,\n      s0,\n      withdrawnAmount,\n      withdrawnToken\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIt's recommended to add `_checkBalances(xi + specifiedAmount, yi)` after  and add `_checkBalances(xi, yi + specifiedAmount)` after .\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation"

These operations include addition and subtraction which are susceptible to integer overflow or underflow, particularly demonstrated in the lines provided. The details explain that specific lines of code may lead to such vulnerabilities when there is an operation that exceeds the data type's limits. The explanation also covers potential issues with type casting from `uint256` to `int256`, and it notes that while some checks for overflows are present with `require(result < INT_MAX)`, they do not protect against underflows or guarantee safety in other operations. The absence of provided implementations of `_applyFeeByRounding` and `_getUtility` functions noted in the snippet means it's not possible to entirely determine if these functions internally handle arithmetic operations safely. Furthermore, the explanation highlights that while Solidity `0.8.x` and above include built-in checks for overflows and underflows, developers must still be careful with type casting and guarantee that all arithmetic operations throughout the contract are handled properly.",

This excess token gets locked in the pool without corresponding to an increase in LP tokens for the provider, causing value loss. The vulnerability is likely associated with the `add` function and the calculation of LP tokens received upon providing liquidity. Though the `_reserveTokenSpecified` function alone does not show this vulnerability directly, the lack of full context and missing implementations of `_applyFeeByRounding` and `_getUtility` prevents a conclusive determination if this function causes the vulnerability.",
