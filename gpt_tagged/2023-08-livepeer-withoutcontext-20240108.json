            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n### Summary\n`updateTranscoderWtihFees` can underflow because MathUtils is used instead of PreciseMathUtils.\n### Proof of Concept\nAccording to  the initial `treasuryRewardCutRate` will be set to `10%`.\n`treasuryRewardCutRate` is set with the `setTreasuryRewardCutRate()`function, which calls the internal function `_setTreasuryRewardCutRate()`. \n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol\n\nfunction _setTreasuryRewardCutRate(uint256 _cutRate) internal {\n        require(PreciseMathUtils.validPerc(_cutRate), \"_cutRate is invalid precise percentage\");\n```\n\nIn this function the value will be checked if it's a valid `PreciseMathUtils` percentage (<100% specified with 27-digits precision):\n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/libraries/PreciseMathUtils.sol\nlibrary PreciseMathUtils {\n// ...\n    // Divisor used for representing percentages\n    uint256 public constant PERC_DIVISOR = 10**27;\n\tfunction validPerc(uint256 _amount) internal pure returns (bool) {\n        return _amount <= PERC_DIVISOR;\n    }\n// ...\n```\n\nHowever, in `updateTranscoderWithFees`, to calculate `treasuryRewards`, `MathUtils` is used instead of `PreciseMathUtils`.\n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol\n\nfunction updateTranscoderWithFees(\n        address _transcoder,\n        uint256 _fees,\n        uint256 _round\n    ) external whenSystemNotPaused onlyTicketBroker {\n// ...\nuint256 treasuryRewards = MathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);\nrewards = rewards.sub(treasuryRewards);\n// ...\n}\n```\n\n`MathUtils` uses a `PREC_DIVISOR` of `1000000` instead of `10 ** 27` from the `PreciseMathUtils`:\n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/libraries/MathUtils.sol\nlibrary MathUtils {\n// ...\n    uint256 public constant PERC_DIVISOR = 1000000;\n// ...\n```\n\nThis leads to `treasuryRewards` value being bigger than expected. Here is a gist of the POC:\n. Running the POC it shows that the current usage of `MathUtils` when calculating `treasuryRewards` will always cause an underflow in the next line of code.\n\n`updateTranscoderWithFees` is called every time a winning ticket is redeemed . Whenever the transcoder has skipped the previous round reward call, this function has to re-calculate the rewards, as documented in  This re-calculation will always fail due to the underflow shown above. \n### Impact\nThis will lead to accounting errors, unexpected behaviours and can cause a loss of winning tickets.\n\nFirstly, the accounting errors and unexpected behaviours: these are all the storage values getting updated in `updateTranscoderWithFees`:\n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol\n\nfunction updateTranscoderWithFees( address _transcoder,\n        uint256 _fees,\n        uint256 _round\n    ) external whenSystemNotPaused onlyTicketBroker {\n// ...\n// transcoder & earningsPool.data\nL314: Transcoder storage t = transcoders[_transcoder];\nL321: EarningsPool.Data storage earningsPool = t.earningsPoolPerRound[currentRound];\n\n//accounting updates happen here\nL377: t.cumulativeFees = t.cumulativeFees.add(transcoderRewardStakeFees)\n\t  .add(transcoderCommissionFees);\nL382: earningsPool.updateCumulativeFeeFactor(prevEarningsPool,delegatorsFees);\nL384: t.lastFeeRound = currentRound;\n```\n- Let `currentRound() - 1` be the previous round where the transcoder skipped the reward call\n- Let `currentRound()` be current round\n- Let `currentRound() + 1` be the next round\n\nDuring `currentRound()` it wont be possible to update the `Transcoder` storage or\n`earningsPool.data` storage because of the underflow that will happen because `currentRound() - 1` reward call has been skipped by the transcoder.\n\nDuring `currentRound() + 1` it will be possible to call `updateTranscoderWithFees`, however, L382 will only update the `prevEarningsPool`, which in this case will be `currentRound()`, not `currentRound - 1`. Therefor, the `EarningsPool.data.cumulativeRewardFactor` won't be updated for `currentRound() - 1`.\n\nLastly, the validity of a ticket is two rounds as per the . This means that a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` should be able to redeem it in `currentRound() - 1` and `currentRound()`. However, a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` wont be able to redeem it in `currentRound()` because of the underflow that happens while redeeming a winning ticket in `currentRound()`. The transcoder wont be able to redeem it after `currentRound + 1..N` because the ticket will be expired.\n## Tools Used\nManual Review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nUse `PreciseMathLib` instead of `MathLib`:\n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol\n\nL355: \n- uint256 treasuryRewards = MathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);\n+ uint256 treasuryRewards = PreciseMathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nLibrary"

                    "description": "The vulnerability described pertains to the incorrect calculation of an accrued amount due to an arithmetic error which is particularly related to the division operation. It's essential to note that the specific vulnerability described in the report is not directly linked to the provided `updateTranscoderWithFees` function. However, the vulnerability described is related to the manipulation of incentive pools using incorrect formulas, which can result in precision loss, eventually causing the value of `incentivePool[tokenAddress]` to tend to zero after several calls due to the division operation on every transaction that calls `getAmountToTransfer`.\n\nSmart contract arithmetic operations, particularly division, may often lead to issues around floating-point arithmetic and precision loss, given that Solidity inherently does not handle floating-point numbers or fractions. Instead, it manages division by truncating the result to the nearest lower integer. When dividing with very large numbers (e.g., `BASE_DIVISOR`), this effect is amplified, causing the loss of significant digits. This rounding error cumulatively leads to a situation where precision loss makes the value stored in `incentivePool[tokenAddress]` ineffective.\n\nConsidering that the provided code snippet does not include the `getAmountToTransfer` function or the arithmetic error described, it's not possible to give a direct proof of concept (PoC) or exactly match the vulnerability with the provided code. However, similar vulnerabilities may potentially manifest in functions like `updateTranscoderWithFees` if any similar arithmetic operations are performed without proper care for integer division behavior. A common mitigation technique is to ensure all multiplications are done before the division and to make use of fixed-point arithmetic libraries, or, as recommended in the report, correct the arithmetic operation to prevent division from occurring with each incentive Pool update.\n\nIn summary, while the provided `updateTranscoderWithFees` function does not demonstrate the vulnerability, the vulnerability report indicates an arithmetic error that can lead to precision loss and depletion of incentive pool value to zero over time. The recommended mitigation solution appears to address the issue by correcting the arithmetic formula and preserving the precision of the `incentivePool[tokenAddress]`.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nA delegate can subtract their own voting weight from the voting choice of another delegate, even if that user isn't a transcoder. Since they are not a transcoder, they don't have their votes initially increased by the amount delegated to them, voting weight is still subtracted from the tally of their vote choice.\n\nMaliciously, this could be used to effectively double one's voting power, by delegating their votes to a delegator who is about to vote for the choice which they don't want. It can also occur accidentally, for example when somebody delegates to a transcoder who later switches role to delegate.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen a user is not a transcoder, their votes are determined by the amount they have delegated to the delegatedAddress, and does not increase when a user delegates to them:\n\n```solidity\n        if (bond.bondedAmount == 0) {\n            amount = 0;\n        } else if (isTranscoder) {\n            amount = bond.delegatedAmount;\n        } else {\n            amount = delegatorCumulativeStakeAt(bond, _round);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nLets that this delegator (Alice) has 100 votes and votes `For`, Then another delegator(Bob) has delegated 1000 votes to Alice As stated above, Alice doesn't get the voting power of Bob's 1000 votes, so the `For` count increases by 100.\n\nBob now votes, and `_handleVotesOverrides` is called. In this function, the first conditional, `if isTranscoder` will return false as Bob is not self-delegating. \n\nThen, there is a check that the address Bob has delegated to has voted. Note that there is a missing check of whether the delegate address is a transcoder. Therefore the logic inside `if (delegateVoter.hasVoted)` is executed:\n\n'''solidity\n    if (delegateVoter.hasVoted) {\n            // this is a delegator overriding its delegated transcoder vote,\n            // we need to update the current totals to move the weight of\n            // the delegator vote to the right outcome.\n            VoteType delegateSupport = delegateVoter.support;\n\n            if (delegateSupport == VoteType.Against) {\n                _tally.againstVotes -= _weight;\n            } else if (delegateSupport == VoteType.For) {\n                _tally.forVotes -= _weight;\n            } else {\n                assert(delegateSupport == VoteType.Abstain);\n                _tally.abstainVotes -= _weight;\n            }\n        }\n'''\n\nThe logic reduces the tally of whatever choice Alice voted for by Bob's weight. Alice initially voted `For` with 100 votes, and then the For votes is reduced by Bob's `1000 votes`. Lets say that Bob votes `Against`. This will result in an aggregate 900 vote reduction in the `For` tally and +1000 votes for `Agaisnt` after Alice and Bob has finished voting.\n\nIf Alice was a transcoder, Bob will be simply reversing the votes they had delegated to Alice. However since Alice was a delegate, they never gained the voting power that was delegated to her.\n\nBob has effectively gained the ability to vote against somebody else's votes (without first actually increasing their voting power since they are not a transcoder) and can vote themselves, which allows them to manipulate governance.\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nThere should be a check that a delegate is a transcoder before subtracting the tally. Here is some pseudocode:\n\n```\nif (delegateVoter.hasVoted && ---delegate is transcoder ---)\n```\n\nThis is an edit of the conditional of the function `_handleOverrides`. This ensures that the subtraction of vote tally is only performed when the delegate is a voter AND the delegate is a transcoder. This should fix the accounting/subtraction issue of vote tally for non-transcoder delegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation"
