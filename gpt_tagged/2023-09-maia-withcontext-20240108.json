This is dangerous because the recipient Dapp on the BranchChain can have a different address or not exist on the Root Chain and therefore if a settlement fails it won't be able to be redeemed since the settlement owner is set as the refundee. Here is a scenario - \n1. dApp A  on a Branch Chain with (`address = 0xbeef`) initiates a  `CallOut(...) 0x01` with `OutputParams (0x01)` for the `RootRouter`\n2. `RootBridgeAgent` executor calls `MulticallRootRouter` `execute()` which then performs some number of arbitrary calls and gets the `OutputParams` assets into the `MulticallRootRouter`\n3. `MulticallRootRouter` attempts to bridge out the assets to the BranchChain and creates a settlement, passing the `recipient (address = 0xbeef)` but also sets the `refundee as (address = 0xbeef)`.\n4. If the settlement fails there is no guarantee that `0xbeef` is a known dApp on the Root Chain and the assets won't be able to be redeemed. \n```solidity\nfunction execute(bytes calldata encodedData, uint16) external payable override lock requiresExecutor {\n        // Parse funcId\n        bytes1 funcId = encodedData[0];\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// code ...\n            /// FUNC ID: 2 (multicallSingleOutput)\n        } else if (funcId == 0x02) {\n            // Decode Params\n            (\n                IMulticall.Call[] memory callData,\n                OutputParams memory outputParams,\n                uint16 dstChainId,\n                GasParams memory gasParams\n            ) = abi.decode(_decode(encodedData[1:]), (IMulticall.Call[], OutputParams, uint16, GasParams));\n\n            // Perform Calls\n            _multicall(callData);\n\n            // Bridge Out assets\n            _approveAndCallOut(\n                outputParams.recipient,\n                outputParams.recipient,\n                outputParams.outputToken,\n                outputParams.amountOut,\n                outputParams.depositOut,\n                dstChainId,\n                gasParams\n            );\n\t\n\t\t\t\t}\n// code ...\n    }\n```\n```solidity\nfunction _createSettlement(\n        uint32 _settlementNonce,\n        address payable _refundee,\n        address _recipient,\n        uint16 _dstChainId,\n        bytes memory _params,\n        address _globalAddress,\n        uint256 _amount,\n        uint256 _deposit,\n        bool _hasFallbackToggled\n    ) internal returns (bytes memory _payload) {\n        // code ...\n\n        // Update Setttlement\n        settlement.owner = _refundee;\n        settlement.recipient = _recipient;\n\n\t\t\t\t// code ...\n      \n    }\n```\n```solidity\nfunction redeemSettlement(uint32 _settlementNonce) external override lock {\n        // Get setttlement storage reference\n        Settlement storage settlement = getSettlement[_settlementNonce];\n\n        // Get deposit owner.\n        address settlementOwner = settlement.owner;\n\n        // Check if Settlement is redeemable.\n        if (settlement.status == STATUS_SUCCESS) revert SettlementRedeemUnavailable();\n        if (settlementOwner == address(0)) revert SettlementRedeemUnavailable();\n\n        // Check if Settlement Owner is msg.sender or msg.sender is the virtual account of the settlement owner.\n        if (msg.sender != settlementOwner) {\n            if (msg.sender != address(IPort(localPortAddress).getUserAccount(settlementOwner))) {\n                revert NotSettlementOwner();\n            }\n        }\n\t\t\t/// more code ...\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Inspection\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nInclude an argument that enables users to specify the refundee when creating settlements without using a Virtual Account\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

This is dangerous because the recipient Dapp on the BranchChain can have a different address or not exist on the Root Chain and therefore if a settlement fails it won't be able to be redeemed since the settlement owner is set as the refundee. Here is a scenario - \n1. dApp A  on a Branch Chain with (`address = 0xbeef`) initiates a  `CallOut(...) 0x01` with `OutputParams (0x01)` for the `RootRouter`\n2. `RootBridgeAgent` executor calls `MulticallRootRouter` `execute()` which then performs some number of arbitrary calls and gets the `OutputParams` assets into the `MulticallRootRouter`\n3. `MulticallRootRouter` attempts to bridge out the assets to the BranchChain and creates a settlement, passing the `recipient (address = 0xbeef)` but also sets the `refundee as (address = 0xbeef)`.\n4. If the settlement fails there is no guarantee that `0xbeef` is a known dApp on the Root Chain and the assets won't be able to be redeemed. \n```solidity\nfunction execute(bytes calldata encodedData, uint16) external payable override lock requiresExecutor {\n        // Parse funcId\n        bytes1 funcId = encodedData[0];\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// code ...\n            /// FUNC ID: 2 (multicallSingleOutput)\n        } else if (funcId == 0x02) {\n            // Decode Params\n            (\n                IMulticall.Call[] memory callData,\n                OutputParams memory outputParams,\n                uint16 dstChainId,\n                GasParams memory gasParams\n            ) = abi.decode(_decode(encodedData[1:]), (IMulticall.Call[], OutputParams, uint16, GasParams));\n\n            // Perform Calls\n            _multicall(callData);\n\n            // Bridge Out assets\n            _approveAndCallOut(\n                outputParams.recipient,\n                outputParams.recipient,\n                outputParams.outputToken,\n                outputParams.amountOut,\n                outputParams.depositOut,\n                dstChainId,\n                gasParams\n            );\n\t\n\t\t\t\t}\n// code ...\n    }\n```\n```solidity\nfunction _createSettlement(\n        uint32 _settlementNonce,\n        address payable _refundee,\n        address _recipient,\n        uint16 _dstChainId,\n        bytes memory _params,\n        address _globalAddress,\n        uint256 _amount,\n        uint256 _deposit,\n        bool _hasFallbackToggled\n    ) internal returns (bytes memory _payload) {\n        // code ...\n\n        // Update Setttlement\n        settlement.owner = _refundee;\n        settlement.recipient = _recipient;\n\n\t\t\t\t// code ...\n      \n    }\n```\n```solidity\nfunction redeemSettlement(uint32 _settlementNonce) external override lock {\n        // Get setttlement storage reference\n        Settlement storage settlement = getSettlement[_settlementNonce];\n\n        // Get deposit owner.\n        address settlementOwner = settlement.owner;\n\n        // Check if Settlement is redeemable.\n        if (settlement.status == STATUS_SUCCESS) revert SettlementRedeemUnavailable();\n        if (settlementOwner == address(0)) revert SettlementRedeemUnavailable();\n\n        // Check if Settlement Owner is msg.sender or msg.sender is the virtual account of the settlement owner.\n        if (msg.sender != settlementOwner) {\n            if (msg.sender != address(IPort(localPortAddress).getUserAccount(settlementOwner))) {\n                revert NotSettlementOwner();\n            }\n        }\n\t\t\t/// more code ...\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Inspection\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nInclude an argument that enables users to specify the refundee when creating settlements without using a Virtual Account\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext"

(2) No `lock` modifier in the `retrySettlement()` function making it susceptive to reentrancy attacks, which might enable repeated settlement invocations and unauthorized fund transfers before the execution state is updated. Both issues expose the smart contract to risks of manipulation and fund theft, with a proof of concept provided showing exploitation of these vulnerabilities. To mitigate these risks, introducing a `lock` modifier to `retrySettlement()` and access control to `createBridgeAgent()` is recommended.",

This is due to the execution protocol marking a deposit nonce as executed based solely on a sufficient gas stipend, without confirming the success of the corresponding fallback. Attempting to retrieve the deposit when a nonce is marked as executed will wrongly return true, implying a processed deposit, which prevents the user from redeeming their deposit via the `redeemDeposit` function.
