            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n### Some theory needed:\n* Currently KelpDAO relies on the following chainlink price feeds in order to calculate rsETH/ETH exchange rate:\n  \n|   | **Price Feed** | **Deviation** | **Heartbeat** |\n|---|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|\n| **1** |  rETH/ETH  |     2%    |   86400s  |\n| **2** |  cbETH/ETH |     1%    |   86400s  |\n| **3** |  stETH/ETH |    0.5%   |   86400s  |\n\n* As we can see, an acceptable deviation for rETH/ETH price feed is about `[-2% 2%]`, meaning that the nodes will not update an on-chain price, in case the boundaries are not reached within the 24h period. These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied. The combination of deviations might be absolutely random, since it operates in set of rational numbers. But it will constantly open a small [+1%; +1.5%] arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.\n  \n## Proof on Concept\n* To reproduce the case described above, slightly change: \n  * `LRTOracleMock`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTOracleMock {\n        uint256 public price;\n\n\n        constructor(uint256 _price) {\n            price = _price;\n        }\n\n        function getAssetPrice(address) external view returns (uint256) {\n            return price;\n        }\n\n        function submitNewAssetPrice(uint256 _newPrice) external {\n            price = _newPrice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  * `setUp()`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTDepositPoolTest is BaseTest, RSETHTest {\n      LRTDepositPool public lrtDepositPool;\n\n        function setUp() public virtual override(RSETHTest, BaseTest) {\n            super.setUp();\n\n            // deploy LRTDepositPool\n            ProxyAdmin proxyAdmin = new ProxyAdmin();\n            LRTDepositPool contractImpl = new LRTDepositPool();\n            TransparentUpgradeableProxy contractProxy = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(\n                address(contractImpl),\n                address(proxyAdmin),\n                \"\"\n            );\n            \n            lrtDepositPool = LRTDepositPool(address(contractProxy));\n\n            // initialize RSETH.

This calculation could be vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow issues because it does not appear to use a safe math library to handle the arithmetic operations. If the resulting product of `amount` and `lrtOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)` is large enough, it could overflow the uint256 limit.

The prices should be considered trustworthy; however, this analysis is strictly focusing on the most likely vulnerability related to the arithmetic operations as per the instructions.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, the use of SafeMath (pre Solidity 0.8.x) or built-in overflow checks (Solidity 0.8.x and later) is critical to prevent such issues.

This inconsistency in the number of shares returned during the first deposit/mint due to the initial total supply being zero can lead to exploitation by an attacker, as evidenced by the provided potential Proof of Concept (PoC). The `previewDeposit` function returns the `assets` as the number of shares, while the `previewMint` returns a fixed `10e18` shares for the first mint operation regardless of the number of shares requested. This creates a vulnerability that allows for manipulation of the pool's share price.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nPrice of rsETH is calculated as `totalLockedETH / rsETHSupply`. rsETH price is used to calculate rsETH amount to mint when user deposits. Formulas are following:\n- `rsethAmountToMint = amount * assetPrice / rsEthPrice`\n- `rsEthPrice = totalEthLocked / rsETHSupply`\n\nProblem is that it transfers deposit amount before calculation of `rsethAmountToMint`. It increases `totalEthLocked`. As a result rsethAmountToMint is less than intended because rsEthPrice is higher.\n\nFor example:\n1) Suppose `totalEthLocked` = 10e18, assetPrice = 1e18, rsETHSupply = 10e18\n2) User deposits 30e18. He expects to receive 30e18 rsETH\n3) However actual received amount will be `30e18 * 1e18 / ((30e18 * 1e18 + 10e18 * 1e18) / 10e18) = 7.5e18`\n\n## Proof of Concept\nHere you can see that it firstly transfers asset to `address(this)`, then calculates amount to mint:\n```solidity\n    function depositAsset(\n        address asset,\n        uint256 depositAmount\n    )\n        external\n        whenNotPaused\n        nonReentrant\n        onlySupportedAsset(asset)\n    {\n        ...\n\n        if (!IERC20(asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), depositAmount)) {\n            revert TokenTransferFailed();\n        }\n\n        // interactions\n        uint256 rsethAmountMinted = _mintRsETH(asset, depositAmount);\n\n        emit AssetDeposit(asset, depositAmount, rsethAmountMinted);\n    }\n```\nThere is long chain of calls:\n```solidity\n_mintRsETH()\n    getRsETHAmountToMint()\n        LRTOracle().getRSETHPrice()\n            getTotalAssetDeposits()\n                getTotalAssetDeposits()\n```\nFinally `getTotalAssetDeposits()` uses current `balanceOf()`, which was increased before by transferrign deposit amount:\n```solidity\n    function getAssetDistributionData(address asset)\n        public\n        view\n        override\n        onlySupportedAsset(asset)\n        returns (uint256 assetLyingInDepositPool, uint256 assetLyingInNDCs, uint256 assetStakedInEigenLayer)\n    {\n        // Question: is here the right place to have this? Could it be in LRTConfig?\n@>      assetLyingInDepositPool = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));\n\n        uint256 ndcsCount = nodeDelegatorQueue.length;\n        for (uint256 i; i < ndcsCount;) {\n            assetLyingInNDCs += IERC20(asset).balanceOf(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]);\n            assetStakedInEigenLayer += INodeDelegator(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]).getAssetBalance(asset);\n            unchecked {\n                ++i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nTransfer tokens in the end:\n```diff\n    function depositAsset(\n        address asset,\n        uint256 depositAmount\n    )\n        external\n        whenNotPaused\n        nonReentrant\n        onlySupportedAsset(asset)\n    {\n        ...\n\n+       uint256 rsethAmountMinted = _mintRsETH(asset, depositAmount);\n\n        if (!IERC20(asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), depositAmount)) {\n            revert TokenTransferFailed();\n        }\n\n-       // interactions\n-       uint256 rsethAmountMinted = _mintRsETH(asset, depositAmount);\n-\n        emit AssetDeposit(asset, depositAmount, rsethAmountMinted);\n    }\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOracle"

                "description": "To properly evaluate the presence of vulnerabilities in the `depositAsset` function provided, we would need more context about the surrounding codebase and the behavior of several key components: 1. `whenNotPaused`: This is likely a modifier to ensure the function cannot be called when the contract is paused. However, I cannot determine its exact behavior and efficacy without the implementation details. 2. `nonReentrant`: This is also a modifier, typically used to prevent reentrancy attacks by ensuring that a function can't be called again until it has completed its execution. Again, the specific implementation is necessary to evaluate its effectiveness in this context. 3. `onlySupportedAsset(asset)`: This modifier likely checks if the asset being deposited is supported by the contract, but the implementation details are crucial to assess whether it properly restricts the function to a list of allowed tokens. 4. `getAssetCurrentLimit(asset)`: This function is used to enforce a maximum deposit limit for the asset. If implemented incorrectly, it could either fail to enforce the limit or be subject to other issues like off-by-one errors or integer overflows, if the numeric operations inside aren't handled safely. 5. `_mintRsETH(asset, depositAmount)`: This function seems to be issuing a new token (rseth) in exchange for the deposited asset. Any weaknesses in its implementation, such as incorrect calculation of the amount to mint or improper handling of internal accounting, could lead to vulnerabilities like overflow/underflow or economic flaws. 6. `IERC20(asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), depositAmount)`: This code interacts with an external ERC20 token. If the ERC20 token does not adhere to the standard (for example, it returns a falsy value even on successful transfers or doesn't throw an error on failure), this could cause the contract to behave unexpectedly. In summary, a thorough evaluation requires the full context, including the modifiers and external function calls.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n### Some theory needed:\n* Currently KelpDAO relies on the following chainlink price feeds in order to calculate rsETH/ETH exchange rate:\n  \n|   | **Price Feed** | **Deviation** | **Heartbeat** |\n|---|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|\n| **1** |  rETH/ETH  |     2%    |   86400s  |\n| **2** |  cbETH/ETH |     1%    |   86400s  |\n| **3** |  stETH/ETH |    0.5%   |   86400s  |\n\n* As we can see, an acceptable deviation for rETH/ETH price feed is about `[-2% 2%]`, meaning that the nodes will not update an on-chain price, in case the boundaries are not reached within the 24h period. These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied. The combination of deviations might be absolutely random, since it operates in set of rational numbers. But it will constantly open a small [+1%; +1.5%] arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.\n  \n## Proof on Concept\n* To reproduce the case described above, slightly change: \n  * `LRTOracleMock`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTOracleMock {\n        uint256 public price;\n\n\n        constructor(uint256 _price) {\n            price = _price;\n        }\n\n        function getAssetPrice(address) external view returns (uint256) {\n            return price;\n        }\n\n        function submitNewAssetPrice(uint256 _newPrice) external {\n            price = _newPrice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  * `setUp()`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTDepositPoolTest is BaseTest, RSETHTest {\n      LRTDepositPool public lrtDepositPool;\n\n        function setUp() public virtual override(RSETHTest, BaseTest) {\n            super.setUp();\n\n            // deploy LRTDepositPool\n            ProxyAdmin proxyAdmin = new ProxyAdmin();\n            LRTDepositPool contractImpl = new LRTDepositPool();\n            TransparentUpgradeableProxy contractProxy = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(\n                address(contractImpl),\n                address(proxyAdmin),\n                \"\"\n            );\n            \n            lrtDepositPool = LRTDepositPool(address(contractProxy));\n\n            // initialize RSETH.

This means if the supply is `0`, depositing 1 asset unit would yield 1 share.\n  \n- **Functionality of `previewMint`**: This function, on the other hand, returns `10e18` shares regardless of the number of assets when the supply is zero, which implies that on the first mint, a fixed number of shares (`10e18`) would be minted irrespective of the assets deposited.\n\nThe report suggests that the `deposit` function, which is not shown in the report, likely does not implement the logic to mint a fixed high number of shares on the first deposit, matching the `previewDeposit` function instead of the `previewMint`. This discrepancy could allow an attacker to influence the vault's economics by initially depositing a small number of assets, thus minting a disproportionate number of shares relative to the vault's assets and manipulating future calculations of the share price.\n\nThe Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates that an attacker can use the `deposit` function to mint any number of shares by depositing a small amount, which should not be equal to the number of shares according to `previewMint`. The assert in the PoC validates that an attacker can mint 1 share with 1 asset, which should not be possible according to `previewMint` logic which would return `10e18`.\n\n**Result**: The smart contract code is vulnerable due to a logical inconsistency between the `previewDeposit` and `previewMint` functions in the event of the first deposit. The recommendation provided is that the `deposit` function should match the `previewMint` function's logic to ensure the intended high initial number of shares is minted to protect against manipulation by the first depositor.\n\nHowever, we must point out that the code provided at the end, `getRsETHAmountToMint`, does not match the code discussed in the vulnerability report. This method appears to be using an oracle to determine the number of `rseth` tokens to mint based on the price of an asset and the price of `rseth`. This code snippet is unrelated to the ERC4626 implementation and does not offer any insight into the vulnerability discussed in this question.",

The `EUSD.mint` function incorrectly assumes that a zero `sharesAmount` implies an empty system, leading to inappropriate minting of shares on a 1-to-1 basis even when it should not. A demonstrated Proof of Concept shows that this can be exploited, allowing users to gain more shares than they should for a given amount of eUSD.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nThe first staker can potentially manipulate the price of rsETH through a donation attack, causing subsequent stakers to receive no rsETH after depositing. The first staker can exploit this method to siphon funds from other users.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe mining amount of rsETH is calculated in function `getRsETHAmountToMint` which directly utilizes the total value of the asset divided by the price of a single rsETH.\n\n```solidity\n    function getRsETHAmountToMint(\n        address asset,\n        uint256 amount\n    )\n        public\n        view\n        override\n        returns (uint256 rsethAmountToMint)\n    {\n        // setup oracle contract\n        address lrtOracleAddress = lrtConfig.getContract(LRTConstants.LRT_ORACLE);\n        ILRTOracle lrtOracle = ILRTOracle(lrtOracleAddress);\n\n        // calculate rseth amount to mint based on asset amount and asset exchange rate\n        rsethAmountToMint = (amount * lrtOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)) / lrtOracle.getRSETHPrice();\n    }\n```\n\nSubsequently, the price of rsETH is related to its totalSupply and the total value of deposited assets.\n \n```solidity\n    function getRSETHPrice() external view returns (uint256 rsETHPrice) {\n        address rsETHTokenAddress = lrtConfig.rsETH();\n        uint256 rsEthSupply = IRSETH(rsETHTokenAddress).totalSupply();\n\n        if (rsEthSupply == 0) {\n            return 1 ether;\n        }\n\n        uint256 totalETHInPool;\n        address lrtDepositPoolAddr = lrtConfig.getContract(LRTConstants.LRT_DEPOSIT_POOL);\n\n        address[] memory supportedAssets = lrtConfig.getSupportedAssetList();\n        uint256 supportedAssetCount = supportedAssets.length;\n\n        for (uint16 asset_idx; asset_idx < supportedAssetCount;) {\n            address asset = supportedAssets[asset_idx];\n            uint256 assetER = getAssetPrice(asset);\n\n            uint256 totalAssetAmt = ILRTDepositPool(lrtDepositPoolAddr).getTotalAssetDeposits(asset);\n            totalETHInPool += totalAssetAmt * assetER;\n\n            unchecked {\n                ++asset_idx;\n            }\n        }\n//@audit the price of rsETH is calculated based on the asset and totalSupply\n        return totalETHInPool / rsEthSupply;\n    }\n```\n\nThe total value of deposited assets comprises three parts: the assets in `LRTDepositPool`, the assets in `NodeDelagator`, and the assets in the eigenlayer. Anyone can directly contribute asset tokens to `LRTDepositPool` or `NodeDelegator` to augment the total value of deposited assets.\n\n```solidity\n    function getAssetDistributionData(address asset)\n        public\n        view\n        override\n        onlySupportedAsset(asset)\n        returns (uint256 assetLyingInDepositPool, uint256 assetLyingInNDCs, uint256 assetStakedInEigenLayer)\n    {\n        // Question: is here the right place to have this? Could it be in LRTConfig?\n        assetLyingInDepositPool = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));\n\n        uint256 ndcsCount = nodeDelegatorQueue.length;\n        for (uint256 i; i < ndcsCount;) {\n            assetLyingInNDCs += IERC20(asset).balanceOf(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]);\n            assetStakedInEigenLayer += INodeDelegator(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]).getAssetBalance(asset);\n            unchecked {\n                ++i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Case\n\nTherefore, the price of rsETH is susceptible to manipulation by the first staker, considering the following scenario:\n\n- 1. Alice is the first staker and she deposits 1 USDC (the price of USDC is set to $1), she will get 1 wei rsETH, and the totalSupply of rsETH is 1 wei.\nHere is the test, add it to `test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol` and run with `forge test --match-test test_ControlPrice -vv`.\n```diff\ndiff --git a/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol b/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\nindex 40abc93..63349c2 100644\n--- a/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\n+++ b/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\n@@ -9,10 +9,11 @@ import { ILRTDepositPool } from \"src/interfaces/ILRTDepositPool.sol\";\n\n import { TransparentUpgradeableProxy } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol\";\n import { ProxyAdmin } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/ProxyAdmin.sol\";\n+import \"forge-std/console.sol\";\n\n contract LRTOracleMock {\n     function getAssetPrice(address) external pure returns (uint256) {\n-        return 1e18;\n+        return 1;\n     }\n\n     function getRSETHPrice() external pure returns (uint256) {\n@@ -109,6 +110,23 @@ contract LRTDepositPoolDepositAsset is LRTDepositPoolTest {\n         lrtDepositPool.depositAsset(rETHAddress, 2 ether);\n     }\n\n+    function test_ControlPrice() external {\n+        vm.startPrank(alice);\n+\n+        // alice balance of rsETH before deposit\n+        uint256 aliceBalanceBefore = rseth.balanceOf(address(alice));\n+\n+        rETH.approve(address(lrtDepositPool), 1 ether);\n+        lrtDepositPool.depositAsset(rETHAddress, 1 ether);\n+\n+        // alice balance of rsETH after deposit\n+        uint256 aliceBalanceAfter = rseth.balanceOf(address(alice));\n+        vm.stopPrank();\n+\n+        console.log(\" rsETH of Alice: \", aliceBalanceAfter - aliceBalanceBefore);\n+\n+    }\n+\n     function test_DepositAsset() external {\n         vm.startPrank(alice);\n```\n\n- 2. Alice donates 10000 USDC to the `LRTDepositPool` to inflate the price of rsETH. Now the price of rsETH is: (10000 + 1)ether / 1 wei = 10001 ether\n\n- 3. Any subsequent staker who deposits assets worth less than 10001 USDC will not receive any rsETH, and they won't be able to withdraw the deposited assets either. Alice can directly siphon off these funds.\nFor example, if Bob deposit 10000 USDC, then the `rsethAmountToMint` is (10000 ether * 1) / (10001)ether = 0\n```\nrsethAmountToMint = (amount * lrtOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)) / lrtOracle.getRSETHPrice();\n```\n\nMoreover, there is no check on the actual amount of rsETH received by the user, and the execution continues even if this amount is zero.\n```\n    function _mintRsETH(address _asset, uint256 _amount) private returns (uint256 rsethAmountToMint) {\n        (rsethAmountToMint) = getRsETHAmountToMint(_asset, _amount);\n\n        address rsethToken = lrtConfig.rsETH();\n        // mint rseth for user\n        //@audit sender could receive 0 token\n        IRSETH(rsethToken).mint(msg.sender, rsethAmountToMint);\n    }\n```\n\n\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nIt is recommended to pre-mint some rsETH tokens to prevent price manipulation or ensure that the `rsethAmountToMint` is greater than zero.\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation"

                    "description": "The vulnerability arises from the potential for an attacker to manipulate the prices used to calculate the price of rsETH LP tokens. This could be done by affecting the pool's balance, which in turn influences the prices provided by the `getAssetPrice` function if it lacks safeguards against manipulation. An incorrect price calculation for the rsETH LP tokens could result, which would be a vulnerability in the system. Mitigation would require more robust pricing mechanisms such as using a pricing oracle or TWAP to prevent rapid and large-scale manipulation.",

                    "description": "The function `getRSETHPrice` is potentially vulnerable to the 'Manipulable LP Token Pricing' vulnerability because it relies on the current state of the liquidity pool to determine asset prices through the `getAssetPrice` function, which can be influenced by significant asset dumps. The external inputs used to calculate the LP token price could be manipulated, leading to an inaccurate and exploitable token price. As such, without additional protections or reliable price feeds, the method of calculating `totalETHInPool` for the rETH token price can lead to potential exploitation.",
