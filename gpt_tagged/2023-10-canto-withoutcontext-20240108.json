            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nA malicious user can brick minting, burning and harvesting of liquidity for almost all liquidity providers.\n\nImportant NOTE: This is a different vector from another gas issue, which is iterating over too many ticks in `(int24 i = lowerTick + 10; i <= upperTick - 10; ++i)`. That issue affects wide liquidity positions, while this attack vector affects even liquidity positions with a relatively small number of ticks.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called, under most conditions, for every potentially eligible tick, it will iterate over every `tickTrackingData` in `tickTracking`:\n\n```solidity\nwhile (time < block.timestamp && tickTrackingIndex < numTickTracking)\n```\n\n`tickTracking` is iterated by `tickTrackingIndex++;`\n\nThe array mapped by `tickTracking_` is increased by 1 for a tick every time a trade through the liquidity pool changes the price from a different tick to this tick. This is implemented in the `crossTicks` function:\n\n```solidity\n    function crossTicks(\n        bytes32 poolIdx,\n        int24 exitTick,\n        int24 entryTick\n    ) internal {\n        uint256 numElementsExit = tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick].length;\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick][numElementsExit - 1]\n            .exitTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);\n        StorageLayout.TickTracking memory tickTrackingData = StorageLayout\n            .TickTracking(uint32(block.timestamp), 0);\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][entryTick].push(tickTrackingData);\n    }\n```\nA user could purposely increase the length of the `tickTracking_` array and hence cause the gas limit to be reached whenever the array is looped over.\n\nThe price impact required to cross a tick is from 0 to 1 bps, as 1 bps as the tick width. This is already extremely small, but the attacker could have the swap amount be a very small fraction of a bps if they first swap to make the price end very close to a tick boundary, and then execute multiple extremely small swaps which bounce the price back and forth over the tick boundary.\n\nNote that the CANTO liquidity rewards are targeted to stable pools. An attacker can be quite confident, for example, that a USDC/USDT pool will trade at around \\$1, and the ticks closest to \\$1 will always be eligible for rewards and therefore be looped over by all rewardable positions when `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called. Therefore the attack can be targeted to just one or two ticks to affect almost every user.\n\n`accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called during minting, burning and harvesting liquidity positions. Therefore this gas griefing attack will make all these functions revert, for almost every user. This would basically break the functionality of concentrated liquidity pools on Ambient. \n\nContrast the effect to the cost to the attacker: using the aforementioned attack vector the main cost to the attacker will be the gas costs of performing the swaps. This is far lower than the damage that is done to the protocol/users\n\nOne additional factor which makes this attack easy to execute that crossing ticks even if the entry and exit is within the same `block.timestamp` adds to the array length. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero. \n\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nOne immediate step would to `pop()` tickTrackingData as soon as the exitTimestamp == entryTimestamp. This happens to the last element of the array when `crossTicks` is called. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero.\n\nThe documentation stated that CANTO rewards are meant to be distributed for stable pools for this codebase. The term \"stable\" could have different interpretations, but this reccomendation assumes that this refers to stablecoin-like or pegged asset pairs such as stETH/WETH, USDT/USDC etc.\n\nInstead of iterating through every tick, one could assume a range where the stable assets could lie and then reward all positions that lie within the specified range - in this case +- 10 ticks of the price tick. \n\nThis makes an assumption that these \"stable assets\" will actually stay pegged to each other. However, the current accounting architecture has multiple problems:\n\n- Given the high number of loops required by the current accounting mechanism, there are multiple reasons that gas could run out. This includes iterating through too many ticks or having too many tick entries/exits\n\n- The current mechanism increases the gas costs of all minting, burning and harvesting\n\n- DOS attacks like the one described in this issue are possible.\n\nAssuming a stable price has the downside of misallocating rewards if the stable assets depeg from each other. However, this may be a reasonable tradeoff to prevent this DOS attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nDoS"

                    "description": "The vulnerability report outlines a griefing attack scenario where a malicious actor can perpetually prevent a user from withdrawing their liquidity provided in an AlgebraPool by continuously adding small amounts of liquidity on behalf of the victim. This is because the smart contract is designed to update the 'lastLiquidityAddTimestamp' every time liquidity is added, regardless of the amount, and it mandates a cooldown period ('_liquidityCooldown') before liquidity can be removed again.\n\nDetails supporting the assessment:\n\n1. The 'mint' function allows users to add liquidity on behalf of others using the 'recipient' parameter. When a user (the sender) calls the 'mint' function, they can specify any other user (the recipient) who will then have their liquidity position updated.\n\n2. The 'lastLiquidityAddTimestamp' for the recipient's position is updated if liquidity was successfully added, meaning the 'mint' function was completed without reversion. This update does not consider the intent of the recipient, so even an undesired, minimal addition of liquidity will reset the recipient's cooldown timer.\n\n3. The 'burn' function has a condition that prevents a user from removing their liquidity if the current time is less than the 'lastLiquidityAddTimestamp' plus the cooldown period ('_liquidityCooldown'). This effectively enforces a wait time from the last liquidity addition before the liquidity can be withdrawn.\n\nThis behavior can be abused. A malicious user can repeatedly call the 'mint' function with a small amount of liquidity for a target user (the victim), resetting their cooldown timer with each call. Since the cooldown period can be as long as one day, the victim can be indefinitely prevented from removing their liquidity as long as the attacker continues to perform the action before the cooldown expires.\n\nThe vulnerability report's recommended mitigation steps involve either restricting users to only providing liquidity for themselves or setting the 'liquidityCooldown' to 0 to prevent this type of griefing attack. This can be done by modifying the 'mint' function to require that the 'sender' and 'recipient' are the same, or by adding a check to ensure a meaningful addition of liquidity is required to reset the cooldown timer.",

                    "description": "The vulnerability report describes a potential overflow in the computation of \"second per liquidity inside\" values that could cause the `computeBoostedSecondsInsideX128()` function to revert, particularly under Solidity ^0.8.0, which includes overflow checks by default, unlike Solidity 0.7.x and prior where overflows wrap around. The code excerpt provided in the Proof of Concept shows that `tickLower.secondsPerLiquidityOutsideX128` could be equal to `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` when a lower tick is just initialized, resulting in the subtraction operation leading to an underflow (in Solidity 0.8.x we refer to an underflow when the result is less than the minimum possible value, which behaves as an overflow due to wraparound from the maximum to the minimum value, leading to revert). As per the provided code for `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity`, while this function does not directly calculate the values in question (i.e., `secondPerLiquidityInside` or `secondPerLiquidityOutside`), it does involve manipulation of timestamps, liquidity, and tick tracking which could indirectly be involved in the stated vulnerability during these complex calculations if connected to the same ecosystem of contracts. Additionally, the use of unchecked arithmetic in these computations could exacerbate similar vulnerabilities if not properly accounted for (the code does not use `unchecked`). However, without direct interaction in the function with the variables `secondsPerLiquidityOutsideX128` or `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128`, it is unclear how this specific function integrates with those computations described in the vulnerability report. The function `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` does not appear to lead to arithmetic vulnerabilities on its own based on the provided code. To fully evaluate the vulnerability of the system, we would need a larger view of the codebase, particularly the parts that interact with 'secondsPerLiquidityInsideX128' calculations, since these are integral to the issue reported and are not included within the provided function. If such an overflow issue indeed exists within the codebase, the recommended mitigation step is to use SafeMath libraries for Solidity 0.8.0 or encapsulate the arithmetic operations within an `unchecked` block, as both these approaches will bypass the automatic revert on overflow/underflow and emulate the behavior of Solidity 0.7.x.",

As of Solidity 0.8, arithmetic operations assert that the result stays within the bounds of the data type, and if the bounds are exceeded, the operation will revert. This could potentially lead to a vulnerability in places where an underflow is expected to occur, as it would now cause a revert instead.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nA malicious user can brick minting, burning and harvesting of liquidity for almost all liquidity providers.\n\nImportant NOTE: This is a different vector from another gas issue, which is iterating over too many ticks in `(int24 i = lowerTick + 10; i <= upperTick - 10; ++i)`. That issue affects wide liquidity positions, while this attack vector affects even liquidity positions with a relatively small number of ticks.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called, under most conditions, for every potentially eligible tick, it will iterate over every `tickTrackingData` in `tickTracking`:\n\n```solidity\nwhile (time < block.timestamp && tickTrackingIndex < numTickTracking)\n```\n\n`tickTracking` is iterated by `tickTrackingIndex++;`\n\nThe array mapped by `tickTracking_` is increased by 1 for a tick every time a trade through the liquidity pool changes the price from a different tick to this tick. This is implemented in the `crossTicks` function:\n\n```solidity\n    function crossTicks(\n        bytes32 poolIdx,\n        int24 exitTick,\n        int24 entryTick\n    ) internal {\n        uint256 numElementsExit = tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick].length;\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick][numElementsExit - 1]\n            .exitTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);\n        StorageLayout.TickTracking memory tickTrackingData = StorageLayout\n            .TickTracking(uint32(block.timestamp), 0);\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][entryTick].push(tickTrackingData);\n    }\n```\nA user could purposely increase the length of the `tickTracking_` array and hence cause the gas limit to be reached whenever the array is looped over.\n\nThe price impact required to cross a tick is from 0 to 1 bps, as 1 bps as the tick width. This is already extremely small, but the attacker could have the swap amount be a very small fraction of a bps if they first swap to make the price end very close to a tick boundary, and then execute multiple extremely small swaps which bounce the price back and forth over the tick boundary.\n\nNote that the CANTO liquidity rewards are targeted to stable pools. An attacker can be quite confident, for example, that a USDC/USDT pool will trade at around \\$1, and the ticks closest to \\$1 will always be eligible for rewards and therefore be looped over by all rewardable positions when `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called. Therefore the attack can be targeted to just one or two ticks to affect almost every user.\n\n`accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called during minting, burning and harvesting liquidity positions. Therefore this gas griefing attack will make all these functions revert, for almost every user. This would basically break the functionality of concentrated liquidity pools on Ambient. \n\nContrast the effect to the cost to the attacker: using the aforementioned attack vector the main cost to the attacker will be the gas costs of performing the swaps. This is far lower than the damage that is done to the protocol/users\n\nOne additional factor which makes this attack easy to execute that crossing ticks even if the entry and exit is within the same `block.timestamp` adds to the array length. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero. \n\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nOne immediate step would to `pop()` tickTrackingData as soon as the exitTimestamp == entryTimestamp. This happens to the last element of the array when `crossTicks` is called. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero.\n\nThe documentation stated that CANTO rewards are meant to be distributed for stable pools for this codebase. The term \"stable\" could have different interpretations, but this reccomendation assumes that this refers to stablecoin-like or pegged asset pairs such as stETH/WETH, USDT/USDC etc.\n\nInstead of iterating through every tick, one could assume a range where the stable assets could lie and then reward all positions that lie within the specified range - in this case +- 10 ticks of the price tick. \n\nThis makes an assumption that these \"stable assets\" will actually stay pegged to each other. However, the current accounting architecture has multiple problems:\n\n- Given the high number of loops required by the current accounting mechanism, there are multiple reasons that gas could run out. This includes iterating through too many ticks or having too many tick entries/exits\n\n- The current mechanism increases the gas costs of all minting, burning and harvesting\n\n- DOS attacks like the one described in this issue are possible.\n\nAssuming a stable price has the downside of misallocating rewards if the stable assets depeg from each other. However, this may be a reasonable tradeoff to prevent this DOS attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nDoS"

When the pool crosses a tick, it only updates either `feeGrowthOutside0` or `feeGrowthOutside1`, depending on the direction of the cross. As a result, `feeGrowthBelow + feeGrowthAbove` can actually be greater than `_feeGrowthGlobal`, leading to a negative result when subtracted in Solidity, which causes an underflow and the transaction reverts.\n\nThe provided `crossTicks` function is rudimentary and doesn't show the fee growth calculation nor the updates of the `feeGrowthOutside0` or `feeGrowthOutside1` variables. However, the vulnerability doesn't seem to stem directly from this function but rather from the way the overall system tracks fee growth and applies it during liquidity provision and burning.\n\nA PoC would involve simulating the condition where after a series of swaps, and liquidity provisions, the sums of `feeGrowthBelow` and `feeGrowthAbove` would exceed `_feeGrowthGlobal`, leading to an underflow when calculating `feeGrowthInside0` or `feeGrowthInside1`. The PoC provided in the report gives a sequence of actions that would trigger the underflow: adding liquidity across different ticks, performing swaps to update only one side of the ticks' fee growth, and attempting to add liquidity again, which would revert due to the underflow.\n\nA patch might involve incorporating checks to ensure that `feeGrowthBelow + feeGrowthAbove` is never greater than `_feeGrowthGlobal`. For instance, one could add a conditional statement to verify that the global fee growth is always larger than the sum of the outside fee growths before performing the subtraction.\n\n```\nif (_feeGrowthGlobal0 < feeGrowthBelow0 + feeGrowthAbove0)\n    // handle underflow case\n\nif (_feeGrowthGlobal1 < feeGrowthBelow1 + feeGrowthAbove1)\n    // handle underflow case\n```\n\nHowever, the root problem seems to be the logic that allows for such a condition to occur in the first place, indicating that the algorithm used for tracking and applying fee growth across ticks needs to be reevaluated to prevent such states from emerging.\n\nBased on these details, I recommend a thorough analysis and overhaul of the fee growth tracking system to address the fundamental issues that allow this vulnerability to exist.",
