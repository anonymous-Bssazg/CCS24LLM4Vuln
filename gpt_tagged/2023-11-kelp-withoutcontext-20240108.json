            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n### Some theory needed:\n* Currently KelpDAO relies on the following chainlink price feeds in order to calculate rsETH/ETH exchange rate:\n  \n|   | **Price Feed** | **Deviation** | **Heartbeat** |\n|---|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|\n| **1** |  rETH/ETH  |     2%    |   86400s  |\n| **2** |  cbETH/ETH |     1%    |   86400s  |\n| **3** |  stETH/ETH |    0.5%   |   86400s  |\n\n* As we can see, an acceptable deviation for rETH/ETH price feed is about `[-2% 2%]`, meaning that the nodes will not update an on-chain price, in case the boundaries are not reached within the 24h period. These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied. The combination of deviations might be absolutely random, since it operates in set of rational numbers. But it will constantly open a small [+1%; +1.5%] arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.\n  \n## Proof on Concept\n* To reproduce the case described above, slightly change: \n  * `LRTOracleMock`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTOracleMock {\n        uint256 public price;\n\n\n        constructor(uint256 _price) {\n            price = _price;\n        }\n\n        function getAssetPrice(address) external view returns (uint256) {\n            return price;\n        }\n\n        function submitNewAssetPrice(uint256 _newPrice) external {\n            price = _newPrice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  * `setUp()`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTDepositPoolTest is BaseTest, RSETHTest {\n      LRTDepositPool public lrtDepositPool;\n\n        function setUp() public virtual override(RSETHTest, BaseTest) {\n            super.setUp();\n\n            // deploy LRTDepositPool\n            ProxyAdmin proxyAdmin = new ProxyAdmin();\n            LRTDepositPool contractImpl = new LRTDepositPool();\n            TransparentUpgradeableProxy contractProxy = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(\n                address(contractImpl),\n                address(proxyAdmin),\n                \"\"\n            );\n            \n            lrtDepositPool = LRTDepositPool(address(contractProxy));\n\n            // initialize RSETH.

This is because the numerator in the division can be smaller than the denominator, causing a truncation of the result to 0. The flawed logic then concludes that if `sharesAmount` is 0, `totalSupply` must also be 0, which is not necessarily true. An exploit could occur if a user mints a small enough amount of `EUSD`, resulting in `sharesAmount` being 0, leading to a disproportionate number of shares being minted in comparison to the input, to the detriment of the protocol and other users. The report recommends adding a check to prevent minting if `sharesAmount` is 0 while `totalSupply` is non-zero, highlighting the need to handle integer division carefully in smart contracts.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\nPrice of rsETH is calculated as `totalLockedETH / rsETHSupply`. rsETH price is used to calculate rsETH amount to mint when user deposits. Formulas are following:\n- `rsethAmountToMint = amount * assetPrice / rsEthPrice`\n- `rsEthPrice = totalEthLocked / rsETHSupply`\n\nProblem is that it transfers deposit amount before calculation of `rsethAmountToMint`. It increases `totalEthLocked`. As a result rsethAmountToMint is less than intended because rsEthPrice is higher.\n\nFor example:\n1) Suppose `totalEthLocked` = 10e18, assetPrice = 1e18, rsETHSupply = 10e18\n2) User deposits 30e18. He expects to receive 30e18 rsETH\n3) However actual received amount will be `30e18 * 1e18 / ((30e18 * 1e18 + 10e18 * 1e18) / 10e18) = 7.5e18`\n\n## Proof of Concept\nHere you can see that it firstly transfers asset to `address(this)`, then calculates amount to mint:\n```solidity\n    function depositAsset(\n        address asset,\n        uint256 depositAmount\n    )\n        external\n        whenNotPaused\n        nonReentrant\n        onlySupportedAsset(asset)\n    {\n        ...\n\n        if (!IERC20(asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), depositAmount)) {\n            revert TokenTransferFailed();\n        }\n\n        // interactions\n        uint256 rsethAmountMinted = _mintRsETH(asset, depositAmount);\n\n        emit AssetDeposit(asset, depositAmount, rsethAmountMinted);\n    }\n```\nThere is long chain of calls:\n```solidity\n_mintRsETH()\n    getRsETHAmountToMint()\n        LRTOracle().getRSETHPrice()\n            getTotalAssetDeposits()\n                getTotalAssetDeposits()\n```\nFinally `getTotalAssetDeposits()` uses current `balanceOf()`, which was increased before by transferrign deposit amount:\n```solidity\n    function getAssetDistributionData(address asset)\n        public\n        view\n        override\n        onlySupportedAsset(asset)\n        returns (uint256 assetLyingInDepositPool, uint256 assetLyingInNDCs, uint256 assetStakedInEigenLayer)\n    {\n        // Question: is here the right place to have this? Could it be in LRTConfig?\n@>      assetLyingInDepositPool = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));\n\n        uint256 ndcsCount = nodeDelegatorQueue.length;\n        for (uint256 i; i < ndcsCount;) {\n            assetLyingInNDCs += IERC20(asset).balanceOf(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]);\n            assetStakedInEigenLayer += INodeDelegator(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]).getAssetBalance(asset);\n            unchecked {\n                ++i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nTransfer tokens in the end:\n```diff\n    function depositAsset(\n        address asset,\n        uint256 depositAmount\n    )\n        external\n        whenNotPaused\n        nonReentrant\n        onlySupportedAsset(asset)\n    {\n        ...\n\n+       uint256 rsethAmountMinted = _mintRsETH(asset, depositAmount);\n\n        if (!IERC20(asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), depositAmount)) {\n            revert TokenTransferFailed();\n        }\n\n-       // interactions\n-       uint256 rsethAmountMinted = _mintRsETH(asset, depositAmount);\n-\n        emit AssetDeposit(asset, depositAmount, rsethAmountMinted);\n    }\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOracle"

Although the implementation of the `_mintRsETH` function is not available, the provided description is enough to suggest that the share minting logic is vulnerable to manipulation.

This could allow an attacker to unfairly gain a larger amount of tokens upon withdrawal. The drafted proof of concept (PoC) code exhibits a scenario where a direct transfer to the contract raises the balance and subsequently increases the cost per share, potentially leading to zero shares being minted due to integer division rounding when a subsequent deposit is smaller than the balance increase. The proposed solution involves separate accounting of user deposits to prevent the share price from being affected by tokens sent outside the deposit function. The conclusion indicates that, if related to the described system, the contract would be susceptible to economic attacks and requires modification to avoid exploitation.",

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n### Some theory needed:\n* Currently KelpDAO relies on the following chainlink price feeds in order to calculate rsETH/ETH exchange rate:\n  \n|   | **Price Feed** | **Deviation** | **Heartbeat** |\n|---|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|\n| **1** |  rETH/ETH  |     2%    |   86400s  |\n| **2** |  cbETH/ETH |     1%    |   86400s  |\n| **3** |  stETH/ETH |    0.5%   |   86400s  |\n\n* As we can see, an acceptable deviation for rETH/ETH price feed is about `[-2% 2%]`, meaning that the nodes will not update an on-chain price, in case the boundaries are not reached within the 24h period. These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied. The combination of deviations might be absolutely random, since it operates in set of rational numbers. But it will constantly open a small [+1%; +1.5%] arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.\n  \n## Proof on Concept\n* To reproduce the case described above, slightly change: \n  * `LRTOracleMock`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTOracleMock {\n        uint256 public price;\n\n\n        constructor(uint256 _price) {\n            price = _price;\n        }\n\n        function getAssetPrice(address) external view returns (uint256) {\n            return price;\n        }\n\n        function submitNewAssetPrice(uint256 _newPrice) external {\n            price = _newPrice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  * `setUp()`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTDepositPoolTest is BaseTest, RSETHTest {\n      LRTDepositPool public lrtDepositPool;\n\n        function setUp() public virtual override(RSETHTest, BaseTest) {\n            super.setUp();\n\n            // deploy LRTDepositPool\n            ProxyAdmin proxyAdmin = new ProxyAdmin();\n            LRTDepositPool contractImpl = new LRTDepositPool();\n            TransparentUpgradeableProxy contractProxy = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(\n                address(contractImpl),\n                address(proxyAdmin),\n                \"\"\n            );\n            \n            lrtDepositPool = LRTDepositPool(address(contractProxy));\n\n            // initialize RSETH.

This introduces an arbitrage vulnerability. An additional check of 'totalSupply' is needed to ensure it is zero before assigning the 1:1 mint ratio, preventing the exploit.",

As there are no measures to handle rounding errors in the current calculation, there is a loss of precision leading to a possibly lower rsethAmountToMint than expected.

Solidity automatically floors (or rounds down) the result on division of integers because Solidity does not support floating points. This means that any division operation discards the remainder.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the expectation set by ERC-4626 that certain methods, particularly, those like `previewMint`, should round up rather than down. Thus if the `getRsETHAmountToMint` function is supposed to comply with `previewMint` rounding expectations (rounding up in this case), it is not fulfilling this requirement due to implicit rounding down behavior.\n\nIn the patch provided, an additional check is performed after the division. If the remainder (`(amount * assetPrice) % rsETHPrice`) is greater than 0, it means that the result would have had a fractional part and therefore, we increment `rsethAmountToMint` by 1 to 'round up'.\n\nTo demonstrate this vulnerability, different scenarios can be simulated using test cases in a development environment. The patched function can be implemented and the same simulations run to ensure it now rounds up as expected. The given code is vulnerable to rounding error vulnerabilities that may cause results that do not comply with ERC-4626 rounding expectations, specifically when it comes to rounding up.

            "detail": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nThe first staker can potentially manipulate the price of rsETH through a donation attack, causing subsequent stakers to receive no rsETH after depositing. The first staker can exploit this method to siphon funds from other users.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe mining amount of rsETH is calculated in function `getRsETHAmountToMint` which directly utilizes the total value of the asset divided by the price of a single rsETH.\n\n```solidity\n    function getRsETHAmountToMint(\n        address asset,\n        uint256 amount\n    )\n        public\n        view\n        override\n        returns (uint256 rsethAmountToMint)\n    {\n        // setup oracle contract\n        address lrtOracleAddress = lrtConfig.getContract(LRTConstants.LRT_ORACLE);\n        ILRTOracle lrtOracle = ILRTOracle(lrtOracleAddress);\n\n        // calculate rseth amount to mint based on asset amount and asset exchange rate\n        rsethAmountToMint = (amount * lrtOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)) / lrtOracle.getRSETHPrice();\n    }\n```\n\nSubsequently, the price of rsETH is related to its totalSupply and the total value of deposited assets.\n \n```solidity\n    function getRSETHPrice() external view returns (uint256 rsETHPrice) {\n        address rsETHTokenAddress = lrtConfig.rsETH();\n        uint256 rsEthSupply = IRSETH(rsETHTokenAddress).totalSupply();\n\n        if (rsEthSupply == 0) {\n            return 1 ether;\n        }\n\n        uint256 totalETHInPool;\n        address lrtDepositPoolAddr = lrtConfig.getContract(LRTConstants.LRT_DEPOSIT_POOL);\n\n        address[] memory supportedAssets = lrtConfig.getSupportedAssetList();\n        uint256 supportedAssetCount = supportedAssets.length;\n\n        for (uint16 asset_idx; asset_idx < supportedAssetCount;) {\n            address asset = supportedAssets[asset_idx];\n            uint256 assetER = getAssetPrice(asset);\n\n            uint256 totalAssetAmt = ILRTDepositPool(lrtDepositPoolAddr).getTotalAssetDeposits(asset);\n            totalETHInPool += totalAssetAmt * assetER;\n\n            unchecked {\n                ++asset_idx;\n            }\n        }\n//@audit the price of rsETH is calculated based on the asset and totalSupply\n        return totalETHInPool / rsEthSupply;\n    }\n```\n\nThe total value of deposited assets comprises three parts: the assets in `LRTDepositPool`, the assets in `NodeDelagator`, and the assets in the eigenlayer. Anyone can directly contribute asset tokens to `LRTDepositPool` or `NodeDelegator` to augment the total value of deposited assets.\n\n```solidity\n    function getAssetDistributionData(address asset)\n        public\n        view\n        override\n        onlySupportedAsset(asset)\n        returns (uint256 assetLyingInDepositPool, uint256 assetLyingInNDCs, uint256 assetStakedInEigenLayer)\n    {\n        // Question: is here the right place to have this? Could it be in LRTConfig?\n        assetLyingInDepositPool = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));\n\n        uint256 ndcsCount = nodeDelegatorQueue.length;\n        for (uint256 i; i < ndcsCount;) {\n            assetLyingInNDCs += IERC20(asset).balanceOf(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]);\n            assetStakedInEigenLayer += INodeDelegator(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]).getAssetBalance(asset);\n            unchecked {\n                ++i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Case\n\nTherefore, the price of rsETH is susceptible to manipulation by the first staker, considering the following scenario:\n\n- 1. Alice is the first staker and she deposits 1 USDC (the price of USDC is set to $1), she will get 1 wei rsETH, and the totalSupply of rsETH is 1 wei.\nHere is the test, add it to `test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol` and run with `forge test --match-test test_ControlPrice -vv`.\n```diff\ndiff --git a/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol b/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\nindex 40abc93..63349c2 100644\n--- a/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\n+++ b/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\n@@ -9,10 +9,11 @@ import { ILRTDepositPool } from \"src/interfaces/ILRTDepositPool.sol\";\n\n import { TransparentUpgradeableProxy } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol\";\n import { ProxyAdmin } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/ProxyAdmin.sol\";\n+import \"forge-std/console.sol\";\n\n contract LRTOracleMock {\n     function getAssetPrice(address) external pure returns (uint256) {\n-        return 1e18;\n+        return 1;\n     }\n\n     function getRSETHPrice() external pure returns (uint256) {\n@@ -109,6 +110,23 @@ contract LRTDepositPoolDepositAsset is LRTDepositPoolTest {\n         lrtDepositPool.depositAsset(rETHAddress, 2 ether);\n     }\n\n+    function test_ControlPrice() external {\n+        vm.startPrank(alice);\n+\n+        // alice balance of rsETH before deposit\n+        uint256 aliceBalanceBefore = rseth.balanceOf(address(alice));\n+\n+        rETH.approve(address(lrtDepositPool), 1 ether);\n+        lrtDepositPool.depositAsset(rETHAddress, 1 ether);\n+\n+        // alice balance of rsETH after deposit\n+        uint256 aliceBalanceAfter = rseth.balanceOf(address(alice));\n+        vm.stopPrank();\n+\n+        console.log(\" rsETH of Alice: \", aliceBalanceAfter - aliceBalanceBefore);\n+\n+    }\n+\n     function test_DepositAsset() external {\n         vm.startPrank(alice);\n```\n\n- 2. Alice donates 10000 USDC to the `LRTDepositPool` to inflate the price of rsETH. Now the price of rsETH is: (10000 + 1)ether / 1 wei = 10001 ether\n\n- 3. Any subsequent staker who deposits assets worth less than 10001 USDC will not receive any rsETH, and they won't be able to withdraw the deposited assets either. Alice can directly siphon off these funds.\nFor example, if Bob deposit 10000 USDC, then the `rsethAmountToMint` is (10000 ether * 1) / (10001)ether = 0\n```\nrsethAmountToMint = (amount * lrtOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)) / lrtOracle.getRSETHPrice();\n```\n\nMoreover, there is no check on the actual amount of rsETH received by the user, and the execution continues even if this amount is zero.\n```\n    function _mintRsETH(address _asset, uint256 _amount) private returns (uint256 rsethAmountToMint) {\n        (rsethAmountToMint) = getRsETHAmountToMint(_asset, _amount);\n\n        address rsethToken = lrtConfig.rsETH();\n        // mint rseth for user\n        //@audit sender could receive 0 token\n        IRSETH(rsethToken).mint(msg.sender, rsethAmountToMint);\n    }\n```\n\n\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nIt is recommended to pre-mint some rsETH tokens to prevent price manipulation or ensure that the `rsethAmountToMint` is greater than zero.\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation"

In non-checking context, overflow/underflow of numeric operations is not checked by the EVM, which could potentially cause vulnerabilities. However, since `asset_idx` is a `uint16` and it's iterating over an array length, the risk of overflow on the index itself is negligible (since arrays can't have more than 2^256-1 elements due to Ethereum limitations, far less than 2^16), but highlighting the unchecked usage is still important because it indicates areas where arithmetic operations are not being checked for over/underflow.\n\n2. The line `totalETHInPool += totalAssetAmt * assetER;` potentially carries a risk if the multiplication `totalAssetAmt * assetER` overflows without detection. Since the operation is within the `unchecked` block, overflows would not revert the transaction and could result in \"wrapping\" of the number, leading to incorrect (and likely much lower) values being added to `totalETHInPool`. This could cause the calculated rsETH price to be incorrect. It's unclear without additional context if `totalAssetAmt` and `assetER` are limited in a way that would prevent this overflow.\n\n3. An additional concern might be the external calls to `lrtConfig.rsETH()`, `lrtConfig.getContract(...)`, `lrtConfig.getSupportedAssetList()`, and `IRSETH(rsETHTokenAddress).totalSupply()`, which can potentially be a source of reentrancy attacks. However, since this function is `view` and doesn't alter state, the reentrancy risk is low in this specific context.\n\n4. Price calculation logic can be manipulated if the asset prices (`getAssetPrice(asset)`) retrieved by the contract can be tampered with. If an attacker is able to manipulate the asset prices, they could inflate or deflate the value of `totalETHInPool`, thus affecting the `rsETHPrice`. This manipulation could come from oracle manipulation, if the asset prices depend on a single source or a few sources that can be tampered with.\n\nTo further ensure the safety of the code, consider adding additional checks, such as:\n\n- Safemath library utilization or the usage of a newer Solidity version (0.8.0 or later), where overflow/underflow checks are built-in for arithmetic operations, to prevent possible arithmetic vulnerabilities.\n- Ensuring that any referenced external contract functions are trustworthy and resistant to tampering, which would involve auditing not only this contract but also `IRSETH`, `ILRTDepositPool`, and any other contracts that are interacted with. \n- Keeping in mind to check assumptions about external contract calls and look for other potential vulnerabilities, including those related to price oracle integrity and manipulation.",
