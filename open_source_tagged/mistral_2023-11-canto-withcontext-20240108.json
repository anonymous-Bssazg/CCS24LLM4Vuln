This error prevents the rightful owner from withdrawing their accrued interest, effectively locking the assets. The primary issue lies in the calculation of `maximumWithdrawable` within `withdrawCarry`.\n\n### Flawed Calculation:\n\nThe following code segment is used to determine `maximumWithdrawable`:\n```\nuint256 exchangeRate = CTokenInterface(cNote).exchangeRateCurrent(); // Scaled by 1 * 10^(18 - 8 + Underlying Token Decimals), i.e. 10^(28) in our case\n// The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD\nuint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) / 1e28 - totalSupply();\n```\nThe problem arises with the scaling of `exchangeRate`, which is assumed to be scaled by `10^28`. However, for `CNOTE` in the Canto network, the `exchangeRate` is actually scaled by `10^18`. This discrepancy causes the owner to withdraw only 10^(-10) times the actual interest amount. Consequently, when a non-zero `_amount` is specified, `withdrawCarry` often fails due to the `require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, \"Too many tokens requested\");` condition.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### CNOTE Scaling Verification\n\nAn essential aspect of this audit involves verifying the scaling factor of the `CNOTE` exchange rate. The `exchangeRate` scale for `CNOTE` can be verified in the [Canto Network's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Canto-Network/clm/blob/298377c8711a067a2a49d75a8bf2f90bbbe3de9e/src/CErc20.sol#L15).  Evidence confirming that the exponent of the `CNOTE` exchange rate is indeed `18` can be found through [this link to the token tracker](https://tuber.build/token/0xEe602429Ef7eCe0a13e4FfE8dBC16e101049504C?tab=read_proxy). The data provided there shows the current value of the stored exchange rate (exchangeRateStored) as approximately `1004161485744613000`. This value corresponds to `1.00416 * 1e18`, reaffirming the 10^18 scaling factor.\n\nThis information is critical for accurately understanding the mechanics of CNOTE and ensuring that the smart contract's calculations align with the actual scaling used in the token's implementation. The verification of this scaling factor supports the recommendations for adjusting the main contract's calculations and the associated test cases, as previously outlined.\n\n\n### Testing with Solidity Codes\n\nTesting with the following Solidity code illustrates the actual `CNOTE` values:\n```solidity\nfunction updateBalance() external {\n    updatedUnderlyingBalance = ICNoteSimple(cnote).balanceOfUnderlying(msg.sender);\n    updatedExchangeRate = ICNoteSimple(cnote).exchangeRateCurrent();\n\n    uint256 balance = IERC20(cnote).balanceOf(msg.sender);\n    calculatedUnderlying = balance * updatedExchangeRate / 1e28;\n}\n```\n\nThe corresponding TypeScript logs show a clear discrepancy between the expected and calculated underlying balances,\n```\nconsole.log(\"balanceCnote: \", (Number(balanceCnote) / 1e18).toString());\nconsole.log(\"exchangeRate: \", Number(exchangeRate).toString());\nconsole.log(\"underlyingBalance: \", Number(underlyingBalance).toString());\nconsole.log(\"calculatedUnderlying: \", Number(calculatedUnderlying).toString());\n```\nwith the logs\n```\nbalanceCnote:  400100.9100006097\nexchangeRate:  1004122567006264000\nunderlyingBalance:  4.017503528113544e+23\ncalculatedUnderlying:  40175035281135\n```\n\n\n## Tools Used\n\n- Solidity for interacting with the Canto mainnet.\n- TypeScript for testing and validation.\n\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\n### Using `balanceOfUnderlying` Function\nReplace the flawed calculation with the `balanceOfUnderlying` function. This function accurately calculates the underlying `NOTE` balance and is defined in `CToken.sol` (.\n\n### Proposed Code Modifications: Two alternative implementations are suggested:\n1. Without `balanceOfUnderlying`: Modify the scaling factor in the existing calculation from `1e28` to `1e18`.\n```\nfunction withdrawCarry(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {\n    uint256 exchangeRate = CTokenInterface(cNote).exchangeRateCurrent(); // Scaled by 10^18\n    // The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD\n    uint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) /\n        1e18 -\n        totalSupply();\n    if (_amount == 0) {\n        _amount = maximumWithdrawable;\n    } else {\n        require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, \"Too many tokens requested\");\n    }\n    // Technically, _amount can still be 0 at this point, which would make the following two calls unnecessary.\n    // But we do not handle this case specifically, as the only consequence is that the owner wastes a bit of gas when there is nothing to withdraw\n    uint256 returnCode = CErc20Interface(cNote).redeemUnderlying(_amount);\n    require(returnCode == 0, \"Error when redeeming\"); // 0 on success: https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#redeem\n    IERC20 note = IERC20(CErc20Interface(cNote).underlying());\n    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(note, msg.sender, _amount);\n    emit CarryWithdrawal(_amount);\n}\n```\n\n2. With `balanceOfUnderlying` (Recommended): Utilize the `balanceOfUnderlying` function for a simpler calculation of `maximumWithdrawable`.\n\n```\nfunction withdrawCarry(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {\n    // The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD\n    uint256 maximumWithdrawable = CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOfUnderlying(address(this)) - totalSupply();\n    if (_amount == 0) {\n        _amount = maximumWithdrawable;\n    } else {\n        require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, \"Too many tokens requested\");\n    }\n    // Technically, _amount can still be 0 at this point, which would make the following two calls unnecessary.\n    // But we do not handle this case specifically, as the only consequence is that the owner wastes a bit of gas when there is nothing to withdraw\n    uint256 returnCode = CErc20Interface(cNote).redeemUnderlying(_amount);\n    require(returnCode == 0, \"Error when redeeming\"); // 0 on success: https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#redeem\n    IERC20 note = IERC20(CErc20Interface(cNote).underlying());\n    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(note, msg.sender, _amount);\n    emit CarryWithdrawal(_amount);\n}\n```\n\nThe second option is highly recommended for its accuracy and simplicity.\n\n### Modification of Related Test Codes\n\nPost-modifications to the main contract code, it's essential to update the associated test cases. In the  test contract, all scaling is currently set to `10^28`. To align with the main contract changes, the following modifications are recommended for `MockCNOTE`:\n```\ncontract MockCNOTE is MockERC20 {\n    address public underlying;\n    uint256 public constant SCALE = 1e18;\n    uint256 public exchangeRateCurrent = SCALE;\n\n    constructor(string memory symbol, string memory name, address _underlying) MockERC20(symbol, name) {\n        underlying = _underlying;\n    }\n\n    function mint(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, address(this), amount);\n        _mint(msg.sender, (amount * SCALE) / exchangeRateCurrent);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function redeemUnderlying(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, amount);\n        _burn(msg.sender, (amount * exchangeRateCurrent) / SCALE);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function redeem(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, (amount * exchangeRateCurrent) / SCALE);\n        _burn(msg.sender, amount);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function setExchangeRate(uint256 _exchangeRate) public {\n        exchangeRateCurrent = _exchangeRate;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis revised `MockCNOTE` contract reflects the updated scale factor and aligns with the main contract's logic.\n\n\n### Scenario Testing with Mainnet Forking\n\nFor comprehensive validation, scenario testing using a fork of the mainnet is highly recommended. This approach allows for real-world testing conditions by simulating interactions with existing contracts on the mainnet. It provides a robust environment to verify the correctness and reliability of the contract modifications in real-world scenarios, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected when interfacing with other mainnet contracts.\n\nThis step is crucial to identify potential issues that might not be apparent in isolated or simulated environments, enhancing the overall reliability of the contract before deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath",

Without `balanceOfUnderlying`: Modify the scaling factor in the existing calculation from `1e28` to `1e18`.\n```\nfunction withdrawCarry(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {\n    uint256 exchangeRate = CTokenInterface(cNote).exchangeRateCurrent(); // Scaled by 10^18\n    // The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD\n    uint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) /\n        1e18 -\n        totalSupply();\n    if (_amount == 0) {\n        _amount = maximumWithdrawable;\n    } else {\n        require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, \"Too many tokens requested\");\n    }\n    // Technically, _amount can still be 0 at this point, which would make the following two calls unnecessary.\n    // But we do not handle this case specifically, as the only consequence is that the owner wastes a bit of gas when there is nothing to withdraw\n    uint256 returnCode = CErc20Interface(cNote).redeemUnderlying(_amount);\n    require(returnCode == 0, \"Error when redeeming\"); // 0 on success: https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#redeem\n    IERC20 note = IERC20(CErc20Interface(cNote).underlying());\n    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(note, msg.sender, _amount);\n    emit CarryWithdrawal(_amount);\n}\n```\n\n2. With `balanceOfUnderlying` (Recommended): Utilize the `balanceOfUnderlying` function for a simpler calculation of `maximumWithdrawable`.\n\n```\nfunction withdrawCarry(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {\n    // The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD\n    uint256 maximumWithdrawable = CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOfUnderlying(address(this)) - totalSupply();\n    if (_amount == 0) {\n        _amount = maximumWithdrawable;\n    } else {\n        require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, \"Too many tokens requested\");\n    }\n    // Technically, _amount can still be 0 at this point, which would make the following two calls unnecessary.\n    // But we do not handle this case specifically, as the only consequence is that the owner wastes a bit of gas when there is nothing to withdraw\n    uint256 returnCode = CErc20Interface(cNote).redeemUnderlying(_amount);\n    require(returnCode == 0, \"Error when redeeming\"); // 0 on success: https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#redeem\n    IERC20 note = IERC20(CErc20Interface(cNote).underlying());\n    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(note, msg.sender, _amount);\n    emit CarryWithdrawal(_amount);\n}\n```\n\nThe second option is highly recommended for its accuracy and simplicity.\n\n### Modification of Related Test Codes\n\nPost-modifications to the main contract code, it's essential to update the associated test cases. In the  test contract, all scaling is currently set to `10^28`. To align with the main contract changes, the following modifications are recommended for `MockCNOTE`:\n```\ncontract MockCNOTE is MockERC20 {\n    address public underlying;\n    uint256 public constant SCALE = 1e18;\n    uint256 public exchangeRateCurrent = SCALE;\n\n    constructor(string memory symbol, string memory name, address _underlying) MockERC20(symbol, name) {\n        underlying = _underlying;\n    }\n\n    function mint(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, address(this), amount);\n        _mint(msg.sender, (amount * SCALE) / exchangeRateCurrent);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function redeemUnderlying(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, amount);\n        _burn(msg.sender, (amount * exchangeRateCurrent) / SCALE);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function redeem(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, (amount * exchangeRateCurrent) / SCALE);\n        _burn(msg.sender, amount);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function setExchangeRate(uint256 _exchangeRate) public {\n        exchangeRateCurrent = _exchangeRate;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis revised `MockCNOTE` contract reflects the updated scale factor and aligns with the main contract's logic.\n\n\n### Scenario Testing with Mainnet Forking\n\nFor comprehensive validation, scenario testing using a fork of the mainnet is highly recommended. This approach allows for real-world testing conditions by simulating interactions with existing contracts on the mainnet. It provides a robust environment to verify the correctness and reliability of the contract modifications in real-world scenarios, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected when interfacing with other mainnet contracts.\n\nThis step is crucial to identify potential issues that might not be apparent in isolated or simulated environments, enhancing the overall reliability of the contract before deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath",

Type of vulnerability: None (the function does not exhibit the given vulnerability)\n\nReason:\n- The function checks if the requested withdrawal amount (_amount) is equal to 0, and if so, it sets _amount to the maximumWithdrawable value (lines 6-11). This behavior is intended to allow the owner to withdraw all available funds when no specific amount is provided.\n- The function includes a conditional statement that checks if the requested amount is less than or equal to the maximumWithdrawable value (lines 13-14). This ensures that the owner can only withdraw the available balance, preventing unauthorized withdrawals.\n- The function uses the 'onlyOwner' modifier, which restricts the execution of this function to the contract owner only, further reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nIn summary, the function contains proper conditional checks and access restrictions, making it unlikely to be vulnerable to unauthorized withdrawals.",
