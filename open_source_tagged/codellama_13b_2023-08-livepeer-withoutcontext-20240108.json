Here is a gist of the POC:\n. Running the POC it shows that the current usage of `MathUtils` when calculating `treasuryRewards` will always cause an underflow in the next line of code.\n\n`updateTranscoderWithFees` is called every time a winning ticket is redeemed . Whenever the transcoder has skipped the previous round reward call, this function has to re-calculate the rewards, as documented in  This re-calculation will always fail due to the underflow shown above. \n### Impact\nThis will lead to accounting errors, unexpected behaviours and can cause a loss of winning tickets.\n\nFirstly, the accounting errors and unexpected behaviours: these are all the storage values getting updated in `updateTranscoderWithFees`:\n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol\n\nfunction updateTranscoderWithFees( address _transcoder,\n        uint256 _fees,\n        uint256 _round\n    ) external whenSystemNotPaused onlyTicketBroker {\n// ...\n// transcoder & earningsPool.data\nL314: Transcoder storage t = transcoders[_transcoder];\nL321: EarningsPool.Data storage earningsPool = t.earningsPoolPerRound[currentRound];\n\n//accounting updates happen here\nL377: t.cumulativeFees = t.cumulativeFees.add(transcoderRewardStakeFees)\n\t  .add(transcoderCommissionFees);\nL382: earningsPool.updateCumulativeFeeFactor(prevEarningsPool,delegatorsFees);\nL384: t.lastFeeRound = currentRound;\n```\n- Let `currentRound() - 1` be the previous round where the transcoder skipped the reward call\n- Let `currentRound()` be current round\n- Let `currentRound() + 1` be the next round\n\nDuring `currentRound()` it wont be possible to update the `Transcoder` storage or\n`earningsPool.data` storage because of the underflow that will happen because `currentRound() - 1` reward call has been skipped by the transcoder.\n\nDuring `currentRound() + 1` it will be possible to call `updateTranscoderWithFees`, however, L382 will only update the `prevEarningsPool`, which in this case will be `currentRound()`, not `currentRound - 1`. Therefor, the `EarningsPool.data.cumulativeRewardFactor` won't be updated for `currentRound() - 1`.\n\nLastly, the validity of a ticket is two rounds as per the . This means that a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` should be able to redeem it in `currentRound() - 1` and `currentRound()`. However, a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` wont be able to redeem it in `currentRound()` because of the underflow that happens while redeeming a winning ticket in `currentRound()`. The transcoder wont be able to redeem it after `currentRound + 1..N` because the ticket will be expired.\n## Tools Used\nManual Review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nUse `PreciseMathLib` instead of `MathLib`:\n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol\n\nL355: \n- uint256 treasuryRewards = MathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);\n+ uint256 treasuryRewards = PreciseMathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nLibrary",

The reason for this is that the code relies on a specific condition being met (i.e., `currentRound > lastRewardRound`) before proceeding with the rest of the function's logic, and this condition could be violated due to external factors such as a transcoder not calling the `reward()` function in the current round.

Incorrect order of operations: The `earningsPool.updateCumulativeFeeFactor()` function is called before calculating the transcoder's cumulative fees, which can result in incorrect calculations of the fees earned by the transcoder based on its earned rewards and feeShare.\n\nThe recommended mitigation step is to update the incentive calculation formula by correctly adjusting the order of arithmetic operations, ultimately ensuring the accurate and intended distribution of token incentives and preventing the unintended lock-up of tokens within the contract.",

Since they are not a transcoder, they don't have their votes initially increased by the amount delegated to them, voting weight is still subtracted from the tally of their vote choice.\n\nMaliciously, this could be used to effectively double one's voting power, by delegating their votes to a delegator who is about to vote for the choice which they don't want. It can also occur accidentally, for example when somebody delegates to a transcoder who later switches role to delegate.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen a user is not a transcoder, their votes are determined by the amount they have delegated to the delegatedAddress, and does not increase when a user delegates to them:\n\n```solidity\n        if (bond.bondedAmount == 0) {\n            amount = 0;\n        } else if (isTranscoder) {\n            amount = bond.delegatedAmount;\n        } else {\n            amount = delegatorCumulativeStakeAt(bond, _round);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nLets that this delegator (Alice) has 100 votes and votes `For`, Then another delegator(Bob) has delegated 1000 votes to Alice As stated above, Alice doesn't get the voting power of Bob's 1000 votes, so the `For` count increases by 100.\n\nBob now votes, and `_handleVotesOverrides` is called. In this function, the first conditional, `if isTranscoder` will return false as Bob is not self-delegating. \n\nThen, there is a check that the address Bob has delegated to has voted. Note that there is a missing check of whether the delegate address is a transcoder. Therefore the logic inside `if (delegateVoter.hasVoted)` is executed:\n\n'''solidity\n    if (delegateVoter.hasVoted) {\n            // this is a delegator overriding its delegated transcoder vote,\n            // we need to update the current totals to move the weight of\n            // the delegator vote to the right outcome.\n            VoteType delegateSupport = delegateVoter.support;\n\n            if (delegateSupport == VoteType.Against) {\n                _tally.againstVotes -= _weight;\n            } else if (delegateSupport == VoteType.For) {\n                _tally.forVotes -= _weight;\n            } else {\n                assert(delegateSupport == VoteType.Abstain);\n                _tally.abstainVotes -= _weight;\n            }\n        }\n'''\n\nThe logic reduces the tally of whatever choice Alice voted for by Bob's weight. Alice initially voted `For` with 100 votes, and then the For votes is reduced by Bob's `1000 votes`. Lets say that Bob votes `Against`. This will result in an aggregate 900 vote reduction in the `For` tally and +1000 votes for `Agaisnt` after Alice and Bob has finished voting.\n\nIf Alice was a transcoder, Bob will be simply reversing the votes they had delegated to Alice. However since Alice was a delegate, they never gained the voting power that was delegated to her.\n\nBob has effectively gained the ability to vote against somebody else's votes (without first actually increasing their voting power since they are not a transcoder) and can vote themselves, which allows them to manipulate governance.\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nThere should be a check that a delegate is a transcoder before subtracting the tally. Here is some pseudocode:\n\n```\nif (delegateVoter.hasVoted && ---delegate is transcoder ---)\n```\n\nThis is an edit of the conditional of the function `_handleOverrides`. This ensures that the subtraction of vote tally is only performed when the delegate is a voter AND the delegate is a transcoder. This should fix the accounting/subtraction issue of vote tally for non-transcoder delegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",

Firstly, the `isTranscoder` variable is set to true if the `delegate` address matches the current transcoder, which means that any user can delegate their voting power to themselves and have it count towards the proposal. This can be exploited by an attacker who can submit a fake delegation transaction for the same proposal multiple times, effectively increasing their own voting power without actually participating in the decision-making process.\n\nSecondly, there is no mechanism to prevent duplicate vote submissions from different addresses that are delegated to the same transcoder.

The actor then uses these borrowed tokens to cast a vote on a proposal, potentially manipulating the outcome of the vote.\n3. Once the actor has finished voting, they return the borrowed tokens to their original owner.\n\nThe vulnerability occurs because the smart contract function `_handleVoteOverrides` allows an attacker to deduce weight from any previous delegators for a transcoder to make a vote, even if those delegators have already voted on a proposal. This means that an attacker can use their borrowed tokens to cast a vote without having to pay the actual gas costs required for voting.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it would be recommended to either:\n\n1.

Since they are not a transcoder, they don't have their votes initially increased by the amount delegated to them, voting weight is still subtracted from the tally of their vote choice.\n\nMaliciously, this could be used to effectively double one's voting power, by delegating their votes to a delegator who is about to vote for the choice which they don't want. It can also occur accidentally, for example when somebody delegates to a transcoder who later switches role to delegate.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen a user is not a transcoder, their votes are determined by the amount they have delegated to the delegatedAddress, and does not increase when a user delegates to them:\n\n```solidity\n        if (bond.bondedAmount == 0) {\n            amount = 0;\n        } else if (isTranscoder) {\n            amount = bond.delegatedAmount;\n        } else {\n            amount = delegatorCumulativeStakeAt(bond, _round);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nLets that this delegator (Alice) has 100 votes and votes `For`, Then another delegator(Bob) has delegated 1000 votes to Alice As stated above, Alice doesn't get the voting power of Bob's 1000 votes, so the `For` count increases by 100.\n\nBob now votes, and `_handleVotesOverrides` is called. In this function, the first conditional, `if isTranscoder` will return false as Bob is not self-delegating. \n\nThen, there is a check that the address Bob has delegated to has voted. Note that there is a missing check of whether the delegate address is a transcoder. Therefore the logic inside `if (delegateVoter.hasVoted)` is executed:\n\n'''solidity\n    if (delegateVoter.hasVoted) {\n            // this is a delegator overriding its delegated transcoder vote,\n            // we need to update the current totals to move the weight of\n            // the delegator vote to the right outcome.\n            VoteType delegateSupport = delegateVoter.support;\n\n            if (delegateSupport == VoteType.Against) {\n                _tally.againstVotes -= _weight;\n            } else if (delegateSupport == VoteType.For) {\n                _tally.forVotes -= _weight;\n            } else {\n                assert(delegateSupport == VoteType.Abstain);\n                _tally.abstainVotes -= _weight;\n            }\n        }\n'''\n\nThe logic reduces the tally of whatever choice Alice voted for by Bob's weight. Alice initially voted `For` with 100 votes, and then the For votes is reduced by Bob's `1000 votes`. Lets say that Bob votes `Against`. This will result in an aggregate 900 vote reduction in the `For` tally and +1000 votes for `Agaisnt` after Alice and Bob has finished voting.\n\nIf Alice was a transcoder, Bob will be simply reversing the votes they had delegated to Alice. However since Alice was a delegate, they never gained the voting power that was delegated to her.\n\nBob has effectively gained the ability to vote against somebody else's votes (without first actually increasing their voting power since they are not a transcoder) and can vote themselves, which allows them to manipulate governance.\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nThere should be a check that a delegate is a transcoder before subtracting the tally. Here is some pseudocode:\n\n```\nif (delegateVoter.hasVoted && ---delegate is transcoder ---)\n```\n\nThis is an edit of the conditional of the function `_handleOverrides`. This ensures that the subtraction of vote tally is only performed when the delegate is a voter AND the delegate is a transcoder. This should fix the accounting/subtraction issue of vote tally for non-transcoder delegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",

This type of attack occurs when an attacker temporarily borrows a large number of tokens to increase their voting weight and manipulate the outcome of a vote, typically during a single transaction.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the smart contract code uses a delegated voting mechanism, where voters can delegate their votes to another address. The `_handleVoteOverrides` function takes in a `delegate` parameter, which allows an attacker to override the vote of the delegated address. This means that if an attacker borrows a large number of tokens and delegates them to themselves, they can manipulate the voting outcome by overriding the vote of their delegated address.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to either use voting weight calculations from previous blocks or cap the weight of individual voters.
