These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied. The combination of deviations might be absolutely random, since it operates in set of rational numbers. But it will constantly open a small [+1%; +1.5%] arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.\n  \n## Proof on Concept\n* To reproduce the case described above, slightly change: \n  * `LRTOracleMock`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTOracleMock {\n        uint256 public price;\n\n\n        constructor(uint256 _price) {\n            price = _price;\n        }\n\n        function getAssetPrice(address) external view returns (uint256) {\n            return price;\n        }\n\n        function submitNewAssetPrice(uint256 _newPrice) external {\n            price = _newPrice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  * `setUp()`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTDepositPoolTest is BaseTest, RSETHTest {\n      LRTDepositPool public lrtDepositPool;\n\n        function setUp() public virtual override(RSETHTest, BaseTest) {\n            super.setUp();\n\n            // deploy LRTDepositPool\n            ProxyAdmin proxyAdmin = new ProxyAdmin();\n            LRTDepositPool contractImpl = new LRTDepositPool();\n            TransparentUpgradeableProxy contractProxy = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(\n                address(contractImpl),\n                address(proxyAdmin),\n                \"\"\n            );\n            \n            lrtDepositPool = LRTDepositPool(address(contractProxy));\n\n            // initialize RSETH.

The reason for this is that the code uses a manipulation-resistant oracle (i.e., the LRT Oracle) to determine the exchange rate between the native asset and synthetics in the pool, but this oracle can be easily manipulated by an attacker through a flash loan.\n\nThe vulnerability occurs when an attacker uses a large temporary loan of foreign assets to artificially manipulate the exchange rate between the native asset and synthetics. This allows the attacker to mint a disproportionately large number of synthetics compared to the native assets used, as the pool believes that the native asset is incredibly valuable due to the manipulated exchange rate. The attacker can then reverse the manipulation by buying back the foreign assets, returning the native assets to their original price or potentially decreasing it further.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the code should utilize a more accurate and tamper-proof oracle, such as one that is based on a decentralized data network like Chainlink, to provide a more reliable exchange rate for minting and burning synthetics.",

Assume that an attacker has a large amount of liquidity and is able to front-run the minting and burning operations. The attacker can then manipulate the price of the asset by minting or burning assets in small quantities repeatedly, causing the price of the asset to fluctuate rapidly. This can lead to unintended losses for users who are relying on the slippage control mechanism to protect their assets.\n\nTo patch this vulnerability, we can add a `minAmountOut` parameter to the minting and burning functions. This parameter will set a minimum amount of assets expected from these operations, ensuring that the functions only execute if the slippage is within an acceptable range defined by the user. By doing so, users can avoid unintended losses due to excessive price fluctuations caused by front-run attacks.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude that the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a slippage control vulnerability due to a lack of parameter for front-run attack protection and requires patching to address this vulnerability.",

These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied. The combination of deviations might be absolutely random, since it operates in set of rational numbers. But it will constantly open a small [+1%; +1.5%] arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.\n  \n## Proof on Concept\n* To reproduce the case described above, slightly change: \n  * `LRTOracleMock`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTOracleMock {\n        uint256 public price;\n\n\n        constructor(uint256 _price) {\n            price = _price;\n        }\n\n        function getAssetPrice(address) external view returns (uint256) {\n            return price;\n        }\n\n        function submitNewAssetPrice(uint256 _newPrice) external {\n            price = _newPrice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  * `setUp()`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTDepositPoolTest is BaseTest, RSETHTest {\n      LRTDepositPool public lrtDepositPool;\n\n        function setUp() public virtual override(RSETHTest, BaseTest) {\n            super.setUp();\n\n            // deploy LRTDepositPool\n            ProxyAdmin proxyAdmin = new ProxyAdmin();\n            LRTDepositPool contractImpl = new LRTDepositPool();\n            TransparentUpgradeableProxy contractProxy = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(\n                address(contractImpl),\n                address(proxyAdmin),\n                \"\"\n            );\n            \n            lrtDepositPool = LRTDepositPool(address(contractProxy));\n\n            // initialize RSETH.

The smart contract has several safeguards in place to prevent the scenario you mentioned from occurring:\n\n1. The `depositAsset` function checks that the user-supplied deposit amount is greater than zero before proceeding with the transfer of assets from the user's account to the smart contract's address. If the deposit amount is zero, the transaction will revert and the attacker will not be able to deposit any tokens.\n2. The function also checks that the user-supplied deposit amount does not exceed the maximum allowable limit for each asset type using `getAssetCurrentLimit`. This function returns the current limit set by the owner of the smart contract, which is a dynamic value that can be adjusted based on market conditions and other factors. If the user's deposit amount exceeds this limit, the transaction will also revert and the attacker will not be able to deposit any tokens.\n3. The function uses `transferFrom` from the IERC20 interface, which is a standard ERC-20 token transfer method that transfers an amount of tokens from one account to another. This function checks that the token transfer was successful before proceeding with the rest of the logic in the function. If the token transfer fails for any reason, including if the user's deposit amount exceeds their available balance or if there is a problem with the token contract, the transaction will revert and the attacker will not be able to deposit any tokens.\n4. The function uses `_mintRsETH` to mint new rsETH tokens based on the user's deposited asset amount. This function calculates the number of rsETH tokens that should be minted based on the current liquidity pool balances and the deposited asset amount, and then mints the correct number of rsETH tokens using the `mint` function from the ERC-20 interface. If there is a problem with the minting process, such as if the minted tokens are not transferred to the user's account successfully, the transaction will revert and the attacker will not be able to deposit any tokens.\n\nOverall, this code is well-written and includes several safeguards to prevent the described attack vector from occurring.

The reason for this vulnerability is that the `mintRsETH` function in the `_mintRsETH` method is not correctly calculating the shares of the users who deposit tokens into the liquidity pool.\n\nHere's how the vulnerability can be exploited: An attacker can send a large amount of tokens as a \"donation\" to the liquidity pool, causing other users who deposit smaller amounts to receive zero shares in return. This occurs because the `mintRsETH` function is calculating the shares based on the ratio of the user's deposited assets to the total supply of the liquidity pool, which can be manipulated by the attacker by adding a disproportionately large amount of tokens to the pool before other users deposit their smaller amounts.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, you would need to modify the `mintRsETH` function to correctly calculate the shares based on the total supply of the liquidity pool after the attacker's \"donation.\" This can be done by adding a line that calculates the total supply of the liquidity pool and divides it by the number of tokens deposited into the pool. This will ensure that each user receives an equal share of the pool, regardless of how large their deposit is compared to the attacker's \"donation.\"\n\nHere is a potential patch for the `mintRsETH` function:\n```solidity\nfunction mintRsETH(address asset, uint256 depositAmount) public onlyOwner {\n    // Calculate the total supply of the liquidity pool after the attacker's \"donation\"\n    uint256 totalSupply = IERC20(asset).totalSupply() + depositAmount;\n\n    // Calculate the shares based on the ratio of the user's deposited assets to the total supply of the liquidity pool\n    uint256 rsethAmountMinted = (depositAmount / totalSupply) * 1000;\n\n    emit AssetDeposit(asset, depositAmount, rsethAmountMinted);\n}\n```\nThis patch",

In the case of the given smart contract, this callback function is the `mintRsETH` function, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause the `depositAsset` function to re-enter and execute arbitrary code.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation:\n1. The `transferFrom` method in the ERC20 standard allows the token being transferred to trigger a callback function in the receiver's contract. In the case of the given smart contract, this callback function is the `mintRsETH` function.\n2. The `mintRsETH` function can be exploited by an attacker to cause the `depositAsset` function to re-enter and execute arbitrary code. This is because the `mintRsETH` function takes in the `asset` argument as input, which is the address of the token being transferred.

The reason for this is that the smart contract includes several checks and interactions that ensure that the minting of RsETH tokens is properly executed.\n\nFirstly, the function `depositAsset` has a `whenNotPaused` modifier, which means that the function can only be called when the contract is not paused. This ensures that no one can call this function while the contract is paused, and therefore, the vulnerability cannot occur.\n\nSecondly, the function checks if the deposit amount is zero before executing any further actions. If the deposit amount is zero, the function reverts with an `InvalidAmount` error. This ensures that no one can mint RsETH tokens with a zero deposit amount, and therefore, the vulnerability cannot occur.\n\nThirdly, the function checks if the deposit amount exceeds the maximum deposit limit for the given asset before executing any further actions. If the deposit amount exceeds the maximum deposit limit, the function reverts with a `MaximumDepositLimitReached` error. This ensures that no one can mint RsETH tokens with a deposit amount greater than the maximum allowed, and therefore, the vulnerability cannot occur.\n\nFinally, the function calls the `_mintRsETH` function to mint the RsETH tokens. The `_mintRsETH` function includes several checks and interactions that ensure that the minting of RsETH tokens is properly executed. For example, it checks if the RsETH token contract has enough balance before minting any new tokens. If the RsETH token contract does not have enough balance, the function reverts with a `TokenBalanceInsufficient` error.\n\nTherefore, based on the given vulnerability knowledge, this smart contract code is not vulnerable to the given vulnerability because it includes several checks and interactions that ensure that the minting of RsETH tokens is properly executed and cannot be manipulated by an attacker to cause undesired outcomes.",

The reason for this is that the calculation of shares in the smart contract involves dividing the user's deposited assets by the underlying balance before the deposit was made. In the given example, the attacker adds a large amount of tokens as a \"donation\" into a newly created liquidity pool, causing users who deposit smaller amounts to receive zero shares in return. However, this type of vulnerability requires that the underlying balance is not updated after the initial deposits are made, which is not the case in the provided code.\n\nThe provided code does not have any issues with rounding errors when calculating shares, and it properly checks for token transfers before minting RsETH tokens. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the given vulnerability knowledge.",

This can result in an incorrect token amount being assigned when minting tokens, leading to potential exploitation and draining of vault assets.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `_mintRsETH` function should be updated to use the correct share amount rather than the asset amount. This can be achieved by passing the `depositAmount` value as an argument to the `_mintRsETH` function and using it to calculate the appropriate share amount to mint.\n\nFor example:\n```solidity\nfunction _mintRsETH(\n    address asset,\n    uint256 depositAmount\n) internal {\n    // ...\n\n    // Calculate the correct share amount based on the deposited asset amount\n    uint256 rsethShareAmount = calculateRsETHShareAmount(depositAmount);\n\n    // Mint the appropriate number of RsETH shares with the calculated amount\n    _mintShares(rsethShareAmount);\n}\n```\nThis updated code will ensure that the correct share amount is minted for each deposited asset, preventing potential exploitation and draining of vault assets.",

This is a vulnerability because it creates the potential for an attacker to steal tokens from users who have set excessive allowances for contracts that are not trusted.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the function allows any external party to call the `transferFrom` function with the user's address as the source, which can result in unauthorized token transfers. This can occur if a malicious contract or attacker has access to a user's allowances and can call the `depositAsset` function with their own address as the destination. By doing so, they can transfer tokens from the user's account without their knowledge or consent.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, it is essential for smart contract developers to restrict the scope of token transfer functions and ensure that they can only pull tokens from the caller (msg.sender). This can be achieved by removing the 'from' parameter from such functions and replacing it with 'msg.sender'.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n### Some theory needed:\n* Currently KelpDAO relies on the following chainlink price feeds in order to calculate rsETH/ETH exchange rate:\n  \n|   | **Price Feed** | **Deviation** | **Heartbeat** |\n|---|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|\n| **1** |  rETH/ETH  |     2%    |   86400s  |\n| **2** |  cbETH/ETH |     1%    |   86400s  |\n| **3** |  stETH/ETH |    0.5%   |   86400s  |\n\n* As we can see, an acceptable deviation for rETH/ETH price feed is about `[-2% 2%]`, meaning that the nodes will not update an on-chain price, in case the boundaries are not reached within the 24h period. These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied.

However, this calculation is performed using the following formula: `(amount * lrtOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)) / lrtOracle.getRSETHPrice()`.\n2.

These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied. The combination of deviations might be absolutely random, since it operates in set of rational numbers. But it will constantly open a small [+1%; +1.5%] arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.\n  \n## Proof on Concept\n* To reproduce the case described above, slightly change: \n  * `LRTOracleMock`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTOracleMock {\n        uint256 public price;\n\n\n        constructor(uint256 _price) {\n            price = _price;\n        }\n\n        function getAssetPrice(address) external view returns (uint256) {\n            return price;\n        }\n\n        function submitNewAssetPrice(uint256 _newPrice) external {\n            price = _newPrice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  * `setUp()`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTDepositPoolTest is BaseTest, RSETHTest {\n      LRTDepositPool public lrtDepositPool;\n\n        function setUp() public virtual override(RSETHTest, BaseTest) {\n            super.setUp();\n\n            // deploy LRTDepositPool\n            ProxyAdmin proxyAdmin = new ProxyAdmin();\n            LRTDepositPool contractImpl = new LRTDepositPool();\n            TransparentUpgradeableProxy contractProxy = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(\n                address(contractImpl),\n                address(proxyAdmin),\n                \"\"\n            );\n            \n            lrtDepositPool = LRTDepositPool(address(contractProxy));\n\n            // initialize RSETH.

Could it be in LRTConfig?\n        assetLyingInDepositPool = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));\n\n        uint256 ndcsCount = nodeDelegatorQueue.length;\n        for (uint256 i; i < ndcsCount;) {\n            assetLyingInNDCs += IERC20(asset).balanceOf(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]);\n            assetStakedInEigenLayer += INodeDelegator(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]).getAssetBalance(asset);\n            unchecked {\n                ++i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Case\n\nTherefore, the price of rsETH is susceptible to manipulation by the first staker, considering the following scenario:\n\n- 1. Alice is the first staker and she deposits 1 USDC (the price of USDC is set to $1), she will get 1 wei rsETH, and the totalSupply of rsETH is 1 wei.\nHere is the test, add it to `test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol` and run with `forge test --match-test test_ControlPrice -vv`.\n```diff\ndiff --git a/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol b/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\nindex 40abc93..63349c2 100644\n--- a/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\n+++ b/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\n@@ -9,10 +9,11 @@ import { ILRTDepositPool } from \"src/interfaces/ILRTDepositPool.sol\";\n\n import { TransparentUpgradeableProxy } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol\";\n import { ProxyAdmin } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/ProxyAdmin.sol\";\n+import \"forge-std/console.sol\";\n\n contract LRTOracleMock {\n     function getAssetPrice(address) external pure returns (uint256) {\n-        return 1e18;\n+        return 1;\n     }\n\n     function getRSETHPrice() external pure returns (uint256) {\n@@ -109,6 +110,23 @@ contract LRTDepositPoolDepositAsset is LRTDepositPoolTest {\n         lrtDepositPool.depositAsset(rETHAddress, 2 ether);\n     }\n\n+    function test_ControlPrice() external {\n+        vm.startPrank(alice);\n+\n+        // alice balance of rsETH before deposit\n+        uint256 aliceBalanceBefore = rseth.balanceOf(address(alice));\n+\n+        rETH.approve(address(lrtDepositPool), 1 ether);\n+        lrtDepositPool.depositAsset(rETHAddress, 1 ether);\n+\n+        // alice balance of rsETH after deposit\n+        uint256 aliceBalanceAfter = rseth.balanceOf(address(alice));\n+        vm.stopPrank();\n+\n+        console.log(\" rsETH of Alice: \", aliceBalanceAfter - aliceBalanceBefore);\n+\n+    }\n+\n     function test_DepositAsset() external {\n         vm.startPrank(alice);\n```\n\n- 2. Alice donates 10000 USDC to the `LRTDepositPool` to inflate the price of rsETH. Now the price of rsETH is: (10000 + 1)ether / 1 wei = 10001 ether\n\n- 3. Any subsequent staker who deposits assets worth less than 10001 USDC will not receive any rsETH, and they won't be able to withdraw the deposited assets either. Alice can directly siphon off these funds.\nFor example, if Bob deposit 10000 USDC, then the `rsethAmountToMint` is (10000 ether * 1) / (10001)ether = 0\n```\nrsethAmountToMint = (amount * lrtOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)) / lrtOracle.getRSETHPrice();\n```\n\nMoreover, there is no check on the actual amount of rsETH received by the user, and the execution continues even if this amount is zero.\n```\n    function _mintRsETH(address _asset, uint256 _amount) private returns (uint256 rsethAmountToMint) {\n        (rsethAmountToMint) = getRsETHAmountToMint(_asset, _amount);\n\n        address rsethToken = lrtConfig.rsETH();\n        // mint rseth for user\n        //@audit sender could receive 0 token\n        IRSETH(rsethToken).mint(msg.sender, rsethAmountToMint);\n    }\n```\n\n\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nIt is recommended to pre-mint some rsETH tokens to prevent price manipulation or ensure that the `rsethAmountToMint` is greater than zero.\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",

The code provided seems to be part of a smart contract that allows for liquidity provision in a pool of two tokens. The function `getRSETHPrice()` appears to be responsible for calculating the price of one of the two tokens in terms of the other token. However, I am not sure what \"RS\" stands for and how it is related to the code provided. Additionally, I cannot find any information about a \"LRT Config\" or \"LRT Deposit Pool\" contract in the code snippet you provided.\n\nAssuming that this code is part of a smart contract that allows for liquidity provision in a pool of two tokens, and that we are analyzing the `getRSETHPrice()` function specifically, I will provide my analysis based on the given vulnerability knowledge.\n\nYes, the provided code is vulnerable to an attack known as \"Inaccurate token amount calculation in adding liquidity\" due to a potential issue with the way the contract calculates the price of one token in terms of the other. The vulnerability occurs when liquidity providers add liquidity to a pool of two tokens, and the token amounts provided have different proportions as compared to the existing liquidity pool. The contract uses the smaller of these proportions to calculate the amount of LP tokens minted, which can result in excess tokens that cannot be redeemed for the amount of LP tokens minted, effectively donating the extra tokens to the pool, which will be shared among all liquidity providers of the pool.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the contract uses an incorrect calculation mechanism when adding liquidity to a pool, resulting in an undesired discrepancy in token proportions when providing liquidity. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to enhance the token amount calculation mechanism while adding liquidity to a pool, similar to how it is handled in Uniswap V2 Router.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given code snippet and vulnerability knowledge, I conclude that the provided smart contract function `getRSETHPrice()` is indeed vulnerable to an \"Inaccurate token amount calculation in adding liquidity\" attack due to a potential issue with the way the contract calcul",
