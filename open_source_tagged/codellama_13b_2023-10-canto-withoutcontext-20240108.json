That issue affects wide liquidity positions, while this attack vector affects even liquidity positions with a relatively small number of ticks.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called, under most conditions, for every potentially eligible tick, it will iterate over every `tickTrackingData` in `tickTracking`:\n\n```solidity\nwhile (time < block.timestamp && tickTrackingIndex < numTickTracking)\n```\n\n`tickTracking` is iterated by `tickTrackingIndex++;`\n\nThe array mapped by `tickTracking_` is increased by 1 for a tick every time a trade through the liquidity pool changes the price from a different tick to this tick. This is implemented in the `crossTicks` function:\n\n```solidity\n    function crossTicks(\n        bytes32 poolIdx,\n        int24 exitTick,\n        int24 entryTick\n    ) internal {\n        uint256 numElementsExit = tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick].length;\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick][numElementsExit - 1]\n            .exitTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);\n        StorageLayout.TickTracking memory tickTrackingData = StorageLayout\n            .TickTracking(uint32(block.timestamp), 0);\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][entryTick].push(tickTrackingData);\n    }\n```\nA user could purposely increase the length of the `tickTracking_` array and hence cause the gas limit to be reached whenever the array is looped over.\n\nThe price impact required to cross a tick is from 0 to 1 bps, as 1 bps as the tick width. This is already extremely small, but the attacker could have the swap amount be a very small fraction of a bps if they first swap to make the price end very close to a tick boundary, and then execute multiple extremely small swaps which bounce the price back and forth over the tick boundary.\n\nNote that the CANTO liquidity rewards are targeted to stable pools. An attacker can be quite confident, for example, that a USDC/USDT pool will trade at around \\$1, and the ticks closest to \\$1 will always be eligible for rewards and therefore be looped over by all rewardable positions when `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called. Therefore the attack can be targeted to just one or two ticks to affect almost every user.\n\n`accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called during minting, burning and harvesting liquidity positions. Therefore this gas griefing attack will make all these functions revert, for almost every user. This would basically break the functionality of concentrated liquidity pools on Ambient. \n\nContrast the effect to the cost to the attacker: using the aforementioned attack vector the main cost to the attacker will be the gas costs of performing the swaps. This is far lower than the damage that is done to the protocol/users\n\nOne additional factor which makes this attack easy to execute that crossing ticks even if the entry and exit is within the same `block.timestamp` adds to the array length. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero. \n\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nOne immediate step would to `pop()` tickTrackingData as soon as the exitTimestamp == entryTimestamp. This happens to the last element of the array when `crossTicks` is called. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero.\n\nThe documentation stated that CANTO rewards are meant to be distributed for stable pools for this codebase. The term \"stable\" could have different interpretations, but this reccomendation assumes that this refers to stablecoin-like or pegged asset pairs such as stETH/WETH, USDT/USDC etc.\n\nInstead of iterating through every tick, one could assume a range where the stable assets could lie and then reward all positions that lie within the specified range - in this case +- 10 ticks of the price tick. \n\nThis makes an assumption that these \"stable assets\" will actually stay pegged to each other. However, the current accounting architecture has multiple problems:\n\n- Given the high number of loops required by the current accounting mechanism, there are multiple reasons that gas could run out. This includes iterating through too many ticks or having too many tick entries/exits\n\n- The current mechanism increases the gas costs of all minting, burning and harvesting\n\n- DOS attacks like the one described in this issue are possible.\n\nAssuming a stable price has the downside of misallocating rewards if the stable assets depeg from each other. However, this may be a reasonable tradeoff to prevent this DOS attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nDoS",

                "decompose": "  Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to unclaimed yield theft in liquidity pool. The reason for this vulnerability is that the function `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` allows users to mint and burn their liquidity tokens to provide or withdraw liquidity from the pool, but it does not properly handle fee distribution within the tick ranges specified by the user.\n\nThe function uses a loop that iterates over all ticks within a specific range and calculates the time-weighted liquidity for each tick based on the accumulated fees within that tick range. However, the function does not properly handle the case where a user mints a small amount of liquidity with the same lower and upper ticks as a legitimate user, allowing the attacker to steal unclaimed yield (fees) accumulated within those ticks.\n\nThe vulnerability arises because the loop uses an `origIndex` variable to keep track of the current index in the tick tracking array, but it does not update this variable when a new tick is entered or exited. This means that if an attacker mints a small amount of liquidity with the same lower and upper ticks as a legitimate user, the function will continue to accumulate fees within those ticks even though the attacker's liquidity has been removed from the pool.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended that the contract developers update the `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` function to correctly handle fee distribution and transfer the appropriate amounts to the users based on their individual contribution to the liquidity pool. This can be achieved by updating the loop to properly handle tick enter/exit events and ensuring that the `origIndex` variable is updated accordingly.",

However, I would like to make a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Use of modular arithmetic in the calculation of `nextWeek`: Instead of using a hardcoded value of 604800 (the number of seconds in a week), it would be more appropriate to use the modulo operator (%) to calculate the difference between the current timestamp and the next week's start time. For example: `nextWeek = (block.timestamp + WEEK) % WEEK;`. This ensures that the calculation is consistent with the definition of a week in Solidity, and reduces the risk of errors caused by hardcoded values.\n2. Handling of overflows: The given code uses the `uint32` data type for storing certain variables, such as `tickTrackingIndexAccruedUpTo_[poolIdx][posKey][i]` and `timeWeightedWeeklyPositionConcLiquidityLastSet_[poolIdx][posKey]`. However, these values can overflow if they exceed the maximum value of `uint32`. To mitigate this risk, it would be better to use a larger data type such as `uint64` for storing these variables.\n3. Use of safe math functions: The given code uses arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, etc.) for calculating certain values, which can lead to overflows or underflows if the input values are large or small enough. To avoid this risk, it would be better to use safe math functions such as `SafeMath.add()` and `SafeMath.sub()` from the OpenZeppelin library instead of using arithmetic operators directly.\n4. Use of constants: The given code defines several constants such as `WEEK`, `lowerTick`, `upperTick` in the `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity()` function. It would be better to define these constants in a separate file or module, and import them where needed instead of defining them in each function. This makes the code more readable and maintainable by separating the constant values from the logic.",

This is already extremely small, but the attacker could have the swap amount be a very small fraction of a bps if they first swap to make the price end very close to a tick boundary, and then execute multiple extremely small swaps which bounce the price back and forth over the tick boundary.\n\nNote that the CANTO liquidity rewards are targeted to stable pools. An attacker can be quite confident, for example, that a USDC/USDT pool will trade at around \\$1, and the ticks closest to \\$1 will always be eligible for rewards and therefore be looped over by all rewardable positions when `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called.

The term \"stable\" could have different interpretations, but this reccomendation assumes that this refers to stablecoin-like or pegged asset pairs such as stETH/WETH, USDT/USDC etc.\n\nInstead of iterating through every tick, one could assume a range where the stable assets could lie and then reward all positions that lie within the specified range - in this case +- 10 ticks of the price tick. \n\nThis makes an assumption that these \"stable assets\" will actually stay pegged to each other.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nA malicious user can brick minting, burning and harvesting of liquidity for almost all liquidity providers.\n\nImportant NOTE: This is a different vector from another gas issue, which is iterating over too many ticks in `(int24 i = lowerTick + 10; i <= upperTick - 10; ++i)`. That issue affects wide liquidity positions, while this attack vector affects even liquidity positions with a relatively small number of ticks.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called, under most conditions, for every potentially eligible tick, it will iterate over every `tickTrackingData` in `tickTracking`:\n\n```solidity\nwhile (time < block.timestamp && tickTrackingIndex < numTickTracking)\n```\n\n`tickTracking` is iterated by `tickTrackingIndex++;`\n\nThe array mapped by `tickTracking_` is increased by 1 for a tick every time a trade through the liquidity pool changes the price from a different tick to this tick. This is implemented in the `crossTicks` function:\n\n```solidity\n    function crossTicks(\n        bytes32 poolIdx,\n        int24 exitTick,\n        int24 entryTick\n    ) internal {\n        uint256 numElementsExit = tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick].length;\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick][numElementsExit - 1]\n            .exitTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);\n        StorageLayout.TickTracking memory tickTrackingData = StorageLayout\n            .TickTracking(uint32(block.timestamp), 0);\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][entryTick].push(tickTrackingData);\n    }\n```\nA user could purposely increase the length of the `tickTracking_` array and hence cause the gas limit to be reached whenever the array is looped over.\n\nThe price impact required to cross a tick is from 0 to 1 bps, as 1 bps as the tick width. This is already extremely small, but the attacker could have the swap amount be a very small fraction of a bps if they first swap to make the price end very close to a tick boundary, and then execute multiple extremely small swaps which bounce the price back and forth over the tick boundary.\n\nNote that the CANTO liquidity rewards are targeted to stable pools. An attacker can be quite confident, for example, that a USDC/USDT pool will trade at around \\$1, and the ticks closest to \\$1 will always be eligible for rewards and therefore be looped over by all rewardable positions when `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called. Therefore the attack can be targeted to just one or two ticks to affect almost every user.\n\n`accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called during minting, burning and harvesting liquidity positions. Therefore this gas griefing attack will make all these functions revert, for almost every user. This would basically break the functionality of concentrated liquidity pools on Ambient. \n\nContrast the effect to the cost to the attacker: using the aforementioned attack vector the main cost to the attacker will be the gas costs of performing the swaps. This is far lower than the damage that is done to the protocol/users\n\nOne additional factor which makes this attack easy to execute that crossing ticks even if the entry and exit is within the same `block.timestamp` adds to the array length. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero. \n\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nOne immediate step would to `pop()` tickTrackingData as soon as the exitTimestamp == entryTimestamp. This happens to the last element of the array when `crossTicks` is called. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero.\n\nThe documentation stated that CANTO rewards are meant to be distributed for stable pools for this codebase. The term \"stable\" could have different interpretations, but this reccomendation assumes that this refers to stablecoin-like or pegged asset pairs such as stETH/WETH, USDT/USDC etc.\n\nInstead of iterating through every tick, one could assume a range where the stable assets could lie and then reward all positions that lie within the specified range - in this case +- 10 ticks of the price tick. \n\nThis makes an assumption that these \"stable assets\" will actually stay pegged to each other. However, the current accounting architecture has multiple problems:\n\n- Given the high number of loops required by the current accounting mechanism, there are multiple reasons that gas could run out. This includes iterating through too many ticks or having too many tick entries/exits\n\n- The current mechanism increases the gas costs of all minting, burning and harvesting\n\n- DOS attacks like the one described in this issue are possible.\n\nAssuming a stable price has the downside of misallocating rewards if the stable assets depeg from each other. However, this may be a reasonable tradeoff to prevent this DOS attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nDoS",

The reason for this is because the `crossTicks` function modifies the state of the contract by calling the `push()` method on an array, which can cause an infinite loop if not properly handled.\n\nIn more detail, the `crossTicks` function takes in three parameters: `poolIdx`, `exitTick`, and `entryTick`. It then retrieves the length of the array at the index specified by `exitTick` using the `length` property and stores it in a variable called `numElementsExit`. The next line of code modifies the last element of the array at the index specified by `exitTick`, which is the `exitTimestamp` property, to be equal to the current block timestamp.\n\nThe vulnerability arises when an attacker calls the `crossTicks` function with a specific set of parameters that cause the `push()` method to be called on an array multiple times. This can happen if the length of the array at the index specified by `entryTick` is greater than 0, which means that there are already elements in the array. When this happens, the attacker can repeatedly call the `crossTicks` function with the same set of parameters and cause the `push()` method to be called multiple times on the same array, leading to an infinite loop.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is important to ensure that the code properly handles the case where there are already elements in the array at the index specified by `entryTick`, and prevents the `push()` method from being called multiple times on the same array. This can be done by using a modifier or an if statement to check whether the length of the array is greater than 0 before calling the `push()` method.\n\nIn conclusion, the given smart contract code is indeed vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to its use of the `push()` method in the `crossTicks` function without proper handling of the case where there are already elements in the array at the index specified by `entryTick`.",

That issue affects wide liquidity positions, while this attack vector affects even liquidity positions with a relatively small number of ticks.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called, under most conditions, for every potentially eligible tick, it will iterate over every `tickTrackingData` in `tickTracking`:\n\n```solidity\nwhile (time < block.timestamp && tickTrackingIndex < numTickTracking)\n```\n\n`tickTracking` is iterated by `tickTrackingIndex++;`\n\nThe array mapped by `tickTracking_` is increased by 1 for a tick every time a trade through the liquidity pool changes the price from a different tick to this tick. This is implemented in the `crossTicks` function:\n\n```solidity\n    function crossTicks(\n        bytes32 poolIdx,\n        int24 exitTick,\n        int24 entryTick\n    ) internal {\n        uint256 numElementsExit = tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick].length;\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick][numElementsExit - 1]\n            .exitTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);\n        StorageLayout.TickTracking memory tickTrackingData = StorageLayout\n            .TickTracking(uint32(block.timestamp), 0);\n        tickTracking_[poolIdx][entryTick].push(tickTrackingData);\n    }\n```\nA user could purposely increase the length of the `tickTracking_` array and hence cause the gas limit to be reached whenever the array is looped over.\n\nThe price impact required to cross a tick is from 0 to 1 bps, as 1 bps as the tick width. This is already extremely small, but the attacker could have the swap amount be a very small fraction of a bps if they first swap to make the price end very close to a tick boundary, and then execute multiple extremely small swaps which bounce the price back and forth over the tick boundary.\n\nNote that the CANTO liquidity rewards are targeted to stable pools. An attacker can be quite confident, for example, that a USDC/USDT pool will trade at around \\$1, and the ticks closest to \\$1 will always be eligible for rewards and therefore be looped over by all rewardable positions when `accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called. Therefore the attack can be targeted to just one or two ticks to affect almost every user.\n\n`accrueConcentratedPositionTimeWeightedLiquidity` is called during minting, burning and harvesting liquidity positions. Therefore this gas griefing attack will make all these functions revert, for almost every user. This would basically break the functionality of concentrated liquidity pools on Ambient. \n\nContrast the effect to the cost to the attacker: using the aforementioned attack vector the main cost to the attacker will be the gas costs of performing the swaps. This is far lower than the damage that is done to the protocol/users\n\nOne additional factor which makes this attack easy to execute that crossing ticks even if the entry and exit is within the same `block.timestamp` adds to the array length. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero. \n\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nOne immediate step would to `pop()` tickTrackingData as soon as the exitTimestamp == entryTimestamp. This happens to the last element of the array when `crossTicks` is called. Tracking this is unnecessary, because the tick was active for 0 blocks, and therefore the time delta and hence allocated rewards is zero.\n\nThe documentation stated that CANTO rewards are meant to be distributed for stable pools for this codebase. The term \"stable\" could have different interpretations, but this reccomendation assumes that this refers to stablecoin-like or pegged asset pairs such as stETH/WETH, USDT/USDC etc.\n\nInstead of iterating through every tick, one could assume a range where the stable assets could lie and then reward all positions that lie within the specified range - in this case +- 10 ticks of the price tick. \n\nThis makes an assumption that these \"stable assets\" will actually stay pegged to each other. However, the current accounting architecture has multiple problems:\n\n- Given the high number of loops required by the current accounting mechanism, there are multiple reasons that gas could run out. This includes iterating through too many ticks or having too many tick entries/exits\n\n- The current mechanism increases the gas costs of all minting, burning and harvesting\n\n- DOS attacks like the one described in this issue are possible.\n\nAssuming a stable price has the downside of misallocating rewards if the stable assets depeg from each other. However, this may be a reasonable tradeoff to prevent this DOS attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nDoS",

The function's purpose is to move assets between two different ticks, which represent different levels of price movement for an underlying asset. The function first retrieves the number of elements currently stored in the `tickTracking_[poolIdx][exitTick]` array and updates the exit timestamp for the last element in the array (i.e., the most recent trade).
