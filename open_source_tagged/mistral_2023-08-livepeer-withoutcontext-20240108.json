Here is a gist of the POC:\n. Running the POC it shows that the current usage of `MathUtils` when calculating `treasuryRewards` will always cause an underflow in the next line of code.\n\n`updateTranscoderWithFees` is called every time a winning ticket is redeemed . Whenever the transcoder has skipped the previous round reward call, this function has to re-calculate the rewards, as documented in  This re-calculation will always fail due to the underflow shown above. \n### Impact\nThis will lead to accounting errors, unexpected behaviours and can cause a loss of winning tickets.\n\nFirstly, the accounting errors and unexpected behaviours: these are all the storage values getting updated in `updateTranscoderWithFees`:\n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol\n\nfunction updateTranscoderWithFees( address _transcoder,\n        uint256 _fees,\n        uint256 _round\n    ) external whenSystemNotPaused onlyTicketBroker {\n// ...\n// transcoder & earningsPool.data\nL314: Transcoder storage t = transcoders[_transcoder];\nL321: EarningsPool.Data storage earningsPool = t.earningsPoolPerRound[currentRound];\n\n//accounting updates happen here\nL377: t.cumulativeFees = t.cumulativeFees.add(transcoderRewardStakeFees)\n\t  .add(transcoderCommissionFees);\nL382: earningsPool.updateCumulativeFeeFactor(prevEarningsPool,delegatorsFees);\nL384: t.lastFeeRound = currentRound;\n```\n- Let `currentRound() - 1` be the previous round where the transcoder skipped the reward call\n- Let `currentRound()` be current round\n- Let `currentRound() + 1` be the next round\n\nDuring `currentRound()` it wont be possible to update the `Transcoder` storage or\n`earningsPool.data` storage because of the underflow that will happen because `currentRound() - 1` reward call has been skipped by the transcoder.\n\nDuring `currentRound() + 1` it will be possible to call `updateTranscoderWithFees`, however, L382 will only update the `prevEarningsPool`, which in this case will be `currentRound()`, not `currentRound - 1`. Therefor, the `EarningsPool.data.cumulativeRewardFactor` won't be updated for `currentRound() - 1`.\n\nLastly, the validity of a ticket is two rounds as per the . This means that a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` should be able to redeem it in `currentRound() - 1` and `currentRound()`. However, a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` wont be able to redeem it in `currentRound()` because of the underflow that happens while redeeming a winning ticket in `currentRound()`. The transcoder wont be able to redeem it after `currentRound + 1..N` because the ticket will be expired.\n## Tools Used\nManual Review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nUse `PreciseMathLib` instead of `MathLib`:\n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol\n\nL355: \n- uint256 treasuryRewards = MathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);\n+ uint256 treasuryRewards = PreciseMathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nLibrary",

Since they are not a transcoder, they don't have their votes initially increased by the amount delegated to them, voting weight is still subtracted from the tally of their vote choice.\n\nMaliciously, this could be used to effectively double one's voting power, by delegating their votes to a delegator who is about to vote for the choice which they don't want. It can also occur accidentally, for example when somebody delegates to a transcoder who later switches role to delegate.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen a user is not a transcoder, their votes are determined by the amount they have delegated to the delegatedAddress, and does not increase when a user delegates to them:\n\n```solidity\n        if (bond.bondedAmount == 0) {\n            amount = 0;\n        } else if (isTranscoder) {\n            amount = bond.delegatedAmount;\n        } else {\n            amount = delegatorCumulativeStakeAt(bond, _round);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nLets that this delegator (Alice) has 100 votes and votes `For`, Then another delegator(Bob) has delegated 1000 votes to Alice As stated above, Alice doesn't get the voting power of Bob's 1000 votes, so the `For` count increases by 100.\n\nBob now votes, and `_handleVotesOverrides` is called. In this function, the first conditional, `if isTranscoder` will return false as Bob is not self-delegating. \n\nThen, there is a check that the address Bob has delegated to has voted. Note that there is a missing check of whether the delegate address is a transcoder. Therefore the logic inside `if (delegateVoter.hasVoted)` is executed:\n\n'''solidity\n    if (delegateVoter.hasVoted) {\n            // this is a delegator overriding its delegated transcoder vote,\n            // we need to update the current totals to move the weight of\n            // the delegator vote to the right outcome.\n            VoteType delegateSupport = delegateVoter.support;\n\n            if (delegateSupport == VoteType.Against) {\n                _tally.againstVotes -= _weight;\n            } else if (delegateSupport == VoteType.For) {\n                _tally.forVotes -= _weight;\n            } else {\n                assert(delegateSupport == VoteType.Abstain);\n                _tally.abstainVotes -= _weight;\n            }\n        }\n'''\n\nThe logic reduces the tally of whatever choice Alice voted for by Bob's weight. Alice initially voted `For` with 100 votes, and then the For votes is reduced by Bob's `1000 votes`. Lets say that Bob votes `Against`. This will result in an aggregate 900 vote reduction in the `For` tally and +1000 votes for `Agaisnt` after Alice and Bob has finished voting.\n\nIf Alice was a transcoder, Bob will be simply reversing the votes they had delegated to Alice. However since Alice was a delegate, they never gained the voting power that was delegated to her.\n\nBob has effectively gained the ability to vote against somebody else's votes (without first actually increasing their voting power since they are not a transcoder) and can vote themselves, which allows them to manipulate governance.\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nThere should be a check that a delegate is a transcoder before subtracting the tally. Here is some pseudocode:\n\n```\nif (delegateVoter.hasVoted && ---delegate is transcoder ---)\n```\n\nThis is an edit of the conditional of the function `_handleOverrides`.

Analyzing the code:\n* The function calculates the `timepoint` as the snapshot of the proposal.\n* It determines if the account is a transcoder by checking if the account is equal to its delegated address at the `timepoint`.\n* If the account is a transcoder, the function deducts the voting power (_weight) from any previous deductions.\n* If the account is a delegator, the function increases the deductions of the transcoder (delegate) by the voting power (_weight).\n* If the transcoder has already voted, the function updates the tally by subtracting the voting power (_weight) from the corresponding vote type (For, Against, or Abstain).\n\n3. Vulnerability analysis:\n* There is no unchecked arithmetic operation within the delegate transfer logic.\n* The smart contract handles the transfer of votes between user addresses (delegators) and assigned delegate addresses (transcoders) correctly.\n* Proper validations and checks are in place to prevent arithmetic underflows and overflows from happening, as seen in the correct usage of the `-` operator for subtraction.\n\nIn conclusion, the smart contract code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described delegate transfer vulnerability, as it correctly handles delegate transfers and implements proper validations and checks to prevent arithmetic underflows and overflows.",

However, in this code, there is no logic that assigns a default value to the delegation mapping or assumes the existence of a previous delegate.\n\nInstead, this code uses the `votes().delegatedAt()` function to retrieve the address of the delegate at a specific timepoint. If there is no delegate assigned to the `_account` at that timepoint, the `delegate` variable will be set to the zero address.\n\nFurthermore, the code checks whether the `_account` is equal to the `delegate` address before deducting any weight from the voter's previous delegations. If the `_account` is not the same as the `delegate` address, the code adds a deduction to the delegated transcoder's `deductions` variable instead.\n\nTherefore, this code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability.",
                "description": "The provided text explains that the smart contract code is not vulnerable to the described issue. The code in question appropriately checks for the existence of a previous delegate using the 'votes().delegatedAt()' function and handles cases where no previous delegate exists by setting the delegate variable to the zero address. Moreover, it ensures that deductions are only made when the '_account' is not the same as the 'delegate' address, guarding against the possibility of a user doubling their voting power.

Specifically, the code does not manipulate vote counts in a way that could be exploited to exceed the maximum voting power.\n\nFurthermore, the code handles delegation by transferring votes between user addresses and delegate addresses correctly, without any logic errors that could result in unintended vote transfers. The code block that handles delegation (`if (isTranscoder)`) is well-structured and does not contain any arithmetic operations that could be susceptible to underflows or overflows.\n\nOverall, the code snippet provided appears to be safe from the specific underflow vulnerability described in the given knowledge.
