        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nThe current `withdrawCarry` function in the contract underestimates the accrued interest due to a miscalculation. This error prevents the rightful owner from withdrawing their accrued interest, effectively locking the assets. The primary issue lies in the calculation of `maximumWithdrawable` within `withdrawCarry`.\n\n### Flawed Calculation:\n\nThe following code segment is used to determine `maximumWithdrawable`:\n```\nuint256 exchangeRate = CTokenInterface(cNote).exchangeRateCurrent(); // Scaled by 1 * 10^(18 - 8 + Underlying Token Decimals), i.e. 10^(28) in our case\n// The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD\nuint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) / 1e28 - totalSupply();\n```\nThe problem arises with the scaling of `exchangeRate`, which is assumed to be scaled by `10^28`. However, for `CNOTE` in the Canto network, the `exchangeRate` is actually scaled by `10^18`. This discrepancy causes the owner to withdraw only 10^(-10) times the actual interest amount. Consequently, when a non-zero `_amount` is specified, `withdrawCarry` often fails due to the `require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, \"Too many tokens requested\");` condition.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### CNOTE Scaling Verification\n\nAn essential aspect of this audit involves verifying the scaling factor of the `CNOTE` exchange rate. The `exchangeRate` scale for `CNOTE` can be verified in the [Canto Network's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Canto-Network/clm/blob/298377c8711a067a2a49d75a8bf2f90bbbe3de9e/src/CErc20.sol#L15).  Evidence confirming that the exponent of the `CNOTE` exchange rate is indeed `18` can be found through [this link to the token tracker](https://tuber.build/token/0xEe602429Ef7eCe0a13e4FfE8dBC16e101049504C?tab=read_proxy). The data provided there shows the current value of the stored exchange rate (exchangeRateStored) as approximately `1004161485744613000`. This value corresponds to `1.00416 * 1e18`, reaffirming the 10^18 scaling factor.\n\nThis information is critical for accurately understanding the mechanics of CNOTE and ensuring that the smart contract's calculations align with the actual scaling used in the token's implementation. The verification of this scaling factor supports the recommendations for adjusting the main contract's calculations and the associated test cases, as previously outlined.\n\n\n### Testing with Solidity Codes\n\nTesting with the following Solidity code illustrates the actual `CNOTE` values:\n```solidity\nfunction updateBalance() external {\n    updatedUnderlyingBalance = ICNoteSimple(cnote).balanceOfUnderlying(msg.sender);\n    updatedExchangeRate = ICNoteSimple(cnote).exchangeRateCurrent();\n\n    uint256 balance = IERC20(cnote).balanceOf(msg.sender);\n    calculatedUnderlying = balance * updatedExchangeRate / 1e28;\n}\n```\n\nThe corresponding TypeScript logs show a clear discrepancy between the expected and calculated underlying balances,\n```\nconsole.log(\"balanceCnote: \", (Number(balanceCnote) / 1e18).toString());\nconsole.log(\"exchangeRate: \", Number(exchangeRate).toString());\nconsole.log(\"underlyingBalance: \", Number(underlyingBalance).toString());\nconsole.log(\"calculatedUnderlying: \", Number(calculatedUnderlying).toString());\n```\nwith the logs\n```\nbalanceCnote:  400100.9100006097\nexchangeRate:  1004122567006264000\nunderlyingBalance:  4.017503528113544e+23\ncalculatedUnderlying:  40175035281135\n```\n\n\n## Tools Used\n\n- Solidity for interacting with the Canto mainnet.\n- TypeScript for testing and validation.\n\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\n### Using `balanceOfUnderlying` Function\nReplace the flawed calculation with the `balanceOfUnderlying` function. This function accurately calculates the underlying `NOTE` balance and is defined in `CToken.sol` (.\n\n### Proposed Code Modifications: Two alternative implementations are suggested:\n1. Without `balanceOfUnderlying`: Modify the scaling factor in the existing calculation from `1e28` to `1e18`.\n```\nfunction withdrawCarry(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {\n    uint256 exchangeRate = CTokenInterface(cNote).exchangeRateCurrent(); // Scaled by 10^18\n    // The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD\n    uint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) /\n        1e18 -\n        totalSupply();\n    if (_amount == 0) {\n        _amount = maximumWithdrawable;\n    } else {\n        require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, \"Too many tokens requested\");\n    }\n    // Technically, _amount can still be 0 at this point, which would make the following two calls unnecessary.\n    // But we do not handle this case specifically, as the only consequence is that the owner wastes a bit of gas when there is nothing to withdraw\n    uint256 returnCode = CErc20Interface(cNote).redeemUnderlying(_amount);\n    require(returnCode == 0, \"Error when redeeming\"); // 0 on success: https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#redeem\n    IERC20 note = IERC20(CErc20Interface(cNote).underlying());\n    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(note, msg.sender, _amount);\n    emit CarryWithdrawal(_amount);\n}\n```\n\n2. With `balanceOfUnderlying` (Recommended): Utilize the `balanceOfUnderlying` function for a simpler calculation of `maximumWithdrawable`.\n\n```\nfunction withdrawCarry(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {\n    // The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD\n    uint256 maximumWithdrawable = CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOfUnderlying(address(this)) - totalSupply();\n    if (_amount == 0) {\n        _amount = maximumWithdrawable;\n    } else {\n        require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, \"Too many tokens requested\");\n    }\n    // Technically, _amount can still be 0 at this point, which would make the following two calls unnecessary.\n    // But we do not handle this case specifically, as the only consequence is that the owner wastes a bit of gas when there is nothing to withdraw\n    uint256 returnCode = CErc20Interface(cNote).redeemUnderlying(_amount);\n    require(returnCode == 0, \"Error when redeeming\"); // 0 on success: https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#redeem\n    IERC20 note = IERC20(CErc20Interface(cNote).underlying());\n    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(note, msg.sender, _amount);\n    emit CarryWithdrawal(_amount);\n}\n```\n\nThe second option is highly recommended for its accuracy and simplicity.\n\n### Modification of Related Test Codes\n\nPost-modifications to the main contract code, it's essential to update the associated test cases. In the  test contract, all scaling is currently set to `10^28`. To align with the main contract changes, the following modifications are recommended for `MockCNOTE`:\n```\ncontract MockCNOTE is MockERC20 {\n    address public underlying;\n    uint256 public constant SCALE = 1e18;\n    uint256 public exchangeRateCurrent = SCALE;\n\n    constructor(string memory symbol, string memory name, address _underlying) MockERC20(symbol, name) {\n        underlying = _underlying;\n    }\n\n    function mint(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, address(this), amount);\n        _mint(msg.sender, (amount * SCALE) / exchangeRateCurrent);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function redeemUnderlying(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, amount);\n        _burn(msg.sender, (amount * exchangeRateCurrent) / SCALE);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function redeem(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, (amount * exchangeRateCurrent) / SCALE);\n        _burn(msg.sender, amount);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function setExchangeRate(uint256 _exchangeRate) public {\n        exchangeRateCurrent = _exchangeRate;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis revised `MockCNOTE` contract reflects the updated scale factor and aligns with the main contract's logic.\n\n\n### Scenario Testing with Mainnet Forking\n\nFor comprehensive validation, scenario testing using a fork of the mainnet is highly recommended. This approach allows for real-world testing conditions by simulating interactions with existing contracts on the mainnet. It provides a robust environment to verify the correctness and reliability of the contract modifications in real-world scenarios, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected when interfacing with other mainnet contracts.\n\nThis step is crucial to identify potential issues that might not be apparent in isolated or simulated environments, enhancing the overall reliability of the contract before deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath",

Specifically, the function first calculates the maximum amount of tokens that can be withdrawn based on the current exchange rate and the total supply of tokens in the contract. Then, if the provided `_amount` is 0, it sets the amount to the maximum withdrawable amount. However, this condition check allows an attacker who owns the contract to withdraw all tokens from the contract without any restrictions by setting `_amount` to 0.\n\nMoreover, this vulnerability can lead to a DoS attack because if an attacker is able to set `_amount` to 0 and trigger the `withdrawCarry` function repeatedly, it could cause the contract to run out of gas and become unusable by other users. This is because the `redeemUnderlying` function called in the function body requires a certain amount of gas to execute, and if the attacker can repeatedly call this function with an empty `_amount`, it could deplete the contract's gas reserves.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is important to ensure that the condition check for withdrawing tokens is properly secured and that the `redeemUnderlying` function is called only when necessary.

This condition allows an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions and perform unauthorized actions by passing an extremely large `_amount` value, which causes the function to withdraw more tokens than what is allowed.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is crucial to implement a secure logic in such functions that adhere to the expected behavior, ensuring only authorized access and actions to avoid any potential unauthorized withdrawals. One possible solution could be to replace the `require` statement with a more robust check, such as verifying the `_amount` value against a predefined threshold or limiting the maximum amount of tokens that can be withdrawn in a single transaction.\n\nTo generate a Proof of Concept (PoC) for this vulnerability, an attacker could try to exploit this function by passing a very large `_amount` value, such as `uint256(-1)` or `uint256(1e30)`, which would cause the function to withdraw all user deposits.

This means that an attacker can deposit a small amount of tokens and manipulate the total shares in such a way that they are able to withdraw a large amount of tokens from the contract.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to deposit a small amount of tokens into the contract, which would increase the total shares and make it possible for them to withdraw a larger amount of tokens than what is actually available in the contract.

This can be achieved by manipulating the `totalSupply` variable, which is not properly checked or restricted.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, consider implementing a minimum balance reserve that cannot be withdrawn by any user under any circumstances.

The `exchangeRateCurrent` function of the cNOTE token interface is used to calculate the maximum withdrawable amount based on the current exchange rate. This function returns a value that is scaled by 10^(28) to account for the difference in decimals between the underlying token and the cTOKEN.\n2. The `balanceOf` function of the cNOTE contract is used to calculate the balance of cNOTE tokens held by the contract. This function returns a value that has already been scaled by 10^(28).\n3. The `totalSupply` function of the cNOTE token interface is used to calculate the total supply of cNOTE tokens in circulation. This function returns a value that is also scaled by 10^(28).\n4. The `redeemUnderlying` function of the cNOTE contract is called with the maximum withdrawable amount as an argument. This function returns a return code (0 for success) which is checked to ensure that it was successful.\n5. The `safeTransfer` function of the SafeERC20 library is used to transfer the withdrawn cNOTE tokens from the contract to the recipient.\n\nIn summary, this smart contract code correctly takes into account the precision loss in the withdrawal calculation and ensures that the correct amount of cNOTE tokens are transferred to the recipient. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the specified precision loss vulnerability.",

The answer is yes, and the most likely vulnerability type is \"Integer Overflow\".\n\nThe reason for this answer is that the smart contract code uses the `exchangeRate` variable to calculate the maximum amount of tokens that can be withdrawn in the `withdrawCarry()` function. However, the calculation uses fixed-point arithmetic with a precision of 28 decimal places, which means that any integer overflow or underflow could lead to an incorrect calculation of the maximum amount of tokens that can be withdrawn.\n\nIn particular, if the `exchangeRate` variable is too large, the multiplication by 10^28 in the calculation of the `maximumWithdrawable` variable could cause an integer overflow. This would lead to an incorrect calculation of the maximum amount of tokens that can be withdrawn, and could result in a revert due to insufficient balance when trying to transfer tokens to the recipient.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, developers should consider using a larger precision for the `exchangeRate` variable or use a different approach to calculate the maximum amount of tokens that can be withdrawn. They could also consider tracking the balance of tokens before and after invoking the withdrawal function and then transferring the difference to the recipient rather than relying solely on the calculated withdrawal amount.\n\nTo generate a potential PoC, I would create a scenario where the `exchangeRate` variable is large enough to cause an integer overflow during the calculation of the `maximumWithdrawable` variable in the `withdrawCarry()` function. This could be done by increasing the value of the `exchangeRate` variable until an integer overflow occurs during the multiplication by 10^28. Once this has been achieved, I would attempt to withdraw a large amount of tokens from the smart contract using the `withdrawCarry()` function and observe whether it reverts due to insufficient balance or not.

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nThe current `withdrawCarry` function in the contract underestimates the accrued interest due to a miscalculation. This error prevents the rightful owner from withdrawing their accrued interest, effectively locking the assets. The primary issue lies in the calculation of `maximumWithdrawable` within `withdrawCarry`.\n\n### Flawed Calculation:\n\nThe following code segment is used to determine `maximumWithdrawable`:\n```\nuint256 exchangeRate = CTokenInterface(cNote).exchangeRateCurrent(); // Scaled by 1 * 10^(18 - 8 + Underlying Token Decimals), i.e. 10^(28) in our case\n// The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD\nuint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) / 1e28 - totalSupply();\n```\nThe problem arises with the scaling of `exchangeRate`, which is assumed to be scaled by `10^28`. However, for `CNOTE` in the Canto network, the `exchangeRate` is actually scaled by `10^18`. This discrepancy causes the owner to withdraw only 10^(-10) times the actual interest amount. Consequently, when a non-zero `_amount` is specified, `withdrawCarry` often fails due to the `require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, \"Too many tokens requested\");` condition.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### CNOTE Scaling Verification\n\nAn essential aspect of this audit involves verifying the scaling factor of the `CNOTE` exchange rate. The `exchangeRate` scale for `CNOTE` can be verified in the [Canto Network's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Canto-Network/clm/blob/298377c8711a067a2a49d75a8bf2f90bbbe3de9e/src/CErc20.sol#L15).  Evidence confirming that the exponent of the `CNOTE` exchange rate is indeed `18` can be found through [this link to the token tracker](https://tuber.build/token/0xEe602429Ef7eCe0a13e4FfE8dBC16e101049504C?tab=read_proxy). The data provided there shows the current value of the stored exchange rate (exchangeRateStored) as approximately `1004161485744613000`. This value corresponds to `1.00416 * 1e18`, reaffirming the 10^18 scaling factor.\n\nThis information is critical for accurately understanding the mechanics of CNOTE and ensuring that the smart contract's calculations align with the actual scaling used in the token's implementation. The verification of this scaling factor supports the recommendations for adjusting the main contract's calculations and the associated test cases, as previously outlined.\n\n\n### Testing with Solidity Codes\n\nTesting with the following Solidity code illustrates the actual `CNOTE` values:\n```solidity\nfunction updateBalance() external {\n    updatedUnderlyingBalance = ICNoteSimple(cnote).balanceOfUnderlying(msg.sender);\n    updatedExchangeRate = ICNoteSimple(cnote).exchangeRateCurrent();\n\n    uint256 balance = IERC20(cnote).balanceOf(msg.sender);\n    calculatedUnderlying = balance * updatedExchangeRate / 1e28;\n}\n```\n\nThe corresponding TypeScript logs show a clear discrepancy between the expected and calculated underlying balances,\n```\nconsole.log(\"balanceCnote: \", (Number(balanceCnote) / 1e18).toString());\nconsole.log(\"exchangeRate: \", Number(exchangeRate).toString());\nconsole.log(\"underlyingBalance: \", Number(underlyingBalance).toString());\nconsole.log(\"calculatedUnderlying: \", Number(calculatedUnderlying).toString());\n```\nwith the logs\n```\nbalanceCnote:  400100.9100006097\nexchangeRate:  1004122567006264000\nunderlyingBalance:  4.017503528113544e+23\ncalculatedUnderlying:  40175035281135\n```\n\n\n## Tools Used\n\n- Solidity for interacting with the Canto mainnet.\n- TypeScript for testing and validation.\n\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\n### Using `balanceOfUnderlying` Function\nReplace the flawed calculation with the `balanceOfUnderlying` function. This function accurately calculates the underlying `NOTE` balance and is defined in `CToken.sol` (.\n\n### Proposed Code Modifications: Two alternative implementations are suggested:\n1. Without `balanceOfUnderlying`: Modify the scaling factor in the existing calculation from `1e28` to `1e18`.\n```\nfunction withdrawCarry(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {\n    uint256 exchangeRate = CTokenInterface(cNote).exchangeRateCurrent(); // Scaled by 10^18\n    // The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD\n    uint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) /\n        1e18 -\n        totalSupply();\n    if (_amount == 0) {\n        _amount = maximumWithdrawable;\n    } else {\n        require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, \"Too many tokens requested\");\n    }\n    // Technically, _amount can still be 0 at this point, which would make the following two calls unnecessary.\n    // But we do not handle this case specifically, as the only consequence is that the owner wastes a bit of gas when there is nothing to withdraw\n    uint256 returnCode = CErc20Interface(cNote).redeemUnderlying(_amount);\n    require(returnCode == 0, \"Error when redeeming\"); // 0 on success: https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#redeem\n    IERC20 note = IERC20(CErc20Interface(cNote).underlying());\n    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(note, msg.sender, _amount);\n    emit CarryWithdrawal(_amount);\n}\n```\n\n2. With `balanceOfUnderlying` (Recommended): Utilize the `balanceOfUnderlying` function for a simpler calculation of `maximumWithdrawable`.\n\n```\nfunction withdrawCarry(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {\n    // The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD\n    uint256 maximumWithdrawable = CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOfUnderlying(address(this)) - totalSupply();\n    if (_amount == 0) {\n        _amount = maximumWithdrawable;\n    } else {\n        require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, \"Too many tokens requested\");\n    }\n    // Technically, _amount can still be 0 at this point, which would make the following two calls unnecessary.\n    // But we do not handle this case specifically, as the only consequence is that the owner wastes a bit of gas when there is nothing to withdraw\n    uint256 returnCode = CErc20Interface(cNote).redeemUnderlying(_amount);\n    require(returnCode == 0, \"Error when redeeming\"); // 0 on success: https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#redeem\n    IERC20 note = IERC20(CErc20Interface(cNote).underlying());\n    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(note, msg.sender, _amount);\n    emit CarryWithdrawal(_amount);\n}\n```\n\nThe second option is highly recommended for its accuracy and simplicity.\n\n### Modification of Related Test Codes\n\nPost-modifications to the main contract code, it's essential to update the associated test cases. In the  test contract, all scaling is currently set to `10^28`. To align with the main contract changes, the following modifications are recommended for `MockCNOTE`:\n```\ncontract MockCNOTE is MockERC20 {\n    address public underlying;\n    uint256 public constant SCALE = 1e18;\n    uint256 public exchangeRateCurrent = SCALE;\n\n    constructor(string memory symbol, string memory name, address _underlying) MockERC20(symbol, name) {\n        underlying = _underlying;\n    }\n\n    function mint(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, address(this), amount);\n        _mint(msg.sender, (amount * SCALE) / exchangeRateCurrent);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function redeemUnderlying(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, amount);\n        _burn(msg.sender, (amount * exchangeRateCurrent) / SCALE);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function redeem(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 statusCode) {\n        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, (amount * exchangeRateCurrent) / SCALE);\n        _burn(msg.sender, amount);\n        statusCode = 0;\n    }\n\n    function setExchangeRate(uint256 _exchangeRate) public {\n        exchangeRateCurrent = _exchangeRate;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis revised `MockCNOTE` contract reflects the updated scale factor and aligns with the main contract's logic.\n\n\n### Scenario Testing with Mainnet Forking\n\nFor comprehensive validation, scenario testing using a fork of the mainnet is highly recommended. This approach allows for real-world testing conditions by simulating interactions with existing contracts on the mainnet. It provides a robust environment to verify the correctness and reliability of the contract modifications in real-world scenarios, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected when interfacing with other mainnet contracts.\n\nThis step is crucial to identify potential issues that might not be apparent in isolated or simulated environments, enhancing the overall reliability of the contract before deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath",
