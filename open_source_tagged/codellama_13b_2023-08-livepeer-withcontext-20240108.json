Here is a gist of the POC:\n. Running the POC it shows that the current usage of `MathUtils` when calculating `treasuryRewards` will always cause an underflow in the next line of code.\n\n`updateTranscoderWithFees` is called every time a winning ticket is redeemed .

Therefor, the `EarningsPool.data.cumulativeRewardFactor` won't be updated for `currentRound() - 1`.\n\nLastly, the validity of a ticket is two rounds as per the . This means that a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` should be able to redeem it in `currentRound() - 1` and `currentRound()`. However, a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` wont be able to redeem it in `currentRound()` because of the underflow that happens while redeeming a winning ticket in `currentRound()`.

This conditional check could be bypassed if the transcoder calls the `reward()` function in the current round but not in the previous round, which could lead to unintended consequences such as a loss of funds or locking of important data.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, one should carefully analyze the control flow of the function and ensure that all essential operations are performed despite the imposed condition.

                "poc_patch": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge, I can identify three potential vulnerabilities in the smart contract code:\n\n1. Unintended Consequences due to Incorrect Conditional Checks:\nThe `updateTranscoderWithFees` function contains multiple conditional checks that are used to restrict certain actions based on specific conditions. However, these checks may not be properly isolated or applied only to the intended action, leading to unintended consequences for stakeholders. For example, if the `currentRound > lastRewardRound` condition is not met, the `earningsPool.setCommission(t.rewardCut, t.feeShare)` line of code will be skipped, which could result in a loss of funds or locking of important data.\n2. Division by Zero:\nThe function contains several division operations that could lead to division by zero errors if the divisor is zero. For example, `EarningsPool.Data memory prevEarningsPool = latestCumulativeFactorsPool(t, currentRound.sub(1));` uses `currentRound.sub(1)` as an argument, which could result in a division by zero error if the subtraction operation results in a value of 0.\n3. Integer Overflow:\nThe function contains several addition and subtraction operations that could lead to integer overflow errors. For example, `t.cumulativeFees = t.cumulativeFees.add(transcoderRewardStakeFees).add(transcoderCommissionFees);` uses the `add` function from the OpenZeppelin library, which could result in an integer overflow error if the addition operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type being used.\n\nOverall, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to unintended consequences due to incorrect conditional checks, division by zero errors, and integer overflow errors. To mitigate these issues, the code should undergo a thorough review and testing process to ensure that all potential vulnerabilities have been identified and addressed.",

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The function `updateTranscoderWithFees` includes a `require` statement to ensure that the `_transcoder` address passed as an argument is registered in the smart contract. This means that only registered transcoders can call this function, and therefore they are not able to arbitrarily adjust platform fees.\n2. The function also has a check to ensure that the current round is greater than or equal to the last reward round for the transcoder. If the current round is less than the last reward round, then the function will not update the transcoder's active cumulative rewards and will instead use the transcoder's current cumulative rewards. This means that the function does not allow the owner of the contract to arbitrarily adjust platform fees by setting a fee for a previous round.\n3. The `updateCumulativeFeeFactor` method on the `EarningsPool.Data` struct includes checks to ensure that the new fees are within certain limits, and that the total stake of all delegators is greater than or equal to zero. This means that the function does not allow the owner of the contract to arbitrarily adjust platform fees by setting a fee that would result in negative cumulative rewards for the transcoder.\n\nOverall, the given smart contract code includes several checks and safeguards to prevent the owner of the contract from arbitrarily adjusting platform fees.

The function \"updateTranscoderWithFees\" allows the owner of the contract to arbitrarily adjust platform fees to an extremely high value, effectively stealing the entire contract balance and any future funds in the account.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that there are no constraints or maximum thresholds on the platform fee-setting function, which means that the owner can set a fee that could result in the funds being misused or sent to an unintended recipient, causing potential financial loss and disruption to the system or token transfers.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a maximum allowable value for platform fees and allow the code to adjust the fees only within this limitation. Alternatively, only permit the fee to be lowered, but never increased.

Since they are not a transcoder, they don't have their votes initially increased by the amount delegated to them, voting weight is still subtracted from the tally of their vote choice.\n\nMaliciously, this could be used to effectively double one's voting power, by delegating their votes to a delegator who is about to vote for the choice which they don't want. It can also occur accidentally, for example when somebody delegates to a transcoder who later switches role to delegate.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen a user is not a transcoder, their votes are determined by the amount they have delegated to the delegatedAddress, and does not increase when a user delegates to them:\n\n```solidity\n        if (bond.bondedAmount == 0) {\n            amount = 0;\n        } else if (isTranscoder) {\n            amount = bond.delegatedAmount;\n        } else {\n            amount = delegatorCumulativeStakeAt(bond, _round);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nLets that this delegator (Alice) has 100 votes and votes `For`, Then another delegator(Bob) has delegated 1000 votes to Alice As stated above, Alice doesn't get the voting power of Bob's 1000 votes, so the `For` count increases by 100.\n\nBob now votes, and `_handleVotesOverrides` is called. In this function, the first conditional, `if isTranscoder` will return false as Bob is not self-delegating. \n\nThen, there is a check that the address Bob has delegated to has voted. Note that there is a missing check of whether the delegate address is a transcoder. Therefore the logic inside `if (delegateVoter.hasVoted)` is executed:\n\n'''solidity\n    if (delegateVoter.hasVoted) {\n            // this is a delegator overriding its delegated transcoder vote,\n            // we need to update the current totals to move the weight of\n            // the delegator vote to the right outcome.\n            VoteType delegateSupport = delegateVoter.support;\n\n            if (delegateSupport == VoteType.Against) {\n                _tally.againstVotes -= _weight;\n            } else if (delegateSupport == VoteType.For) {\n                _tally.forVotes -= _weight;\n            } else {\n                assert(delegateSupport == VoteType.Abstain);\n                _tally.abstainVotes -= _weight;\n            }\n        }\n'''\n\nThe logic reduces the tally of whatever choice Alice voted for by Bob's weight. Alice initially voted `For` with 100 votes, and then the For votes is reduced by Bob's `1000 votes`. Lets say that Bob votes `Against`. This will result in an aggregate 900 vote reduction in the `For` tally and +1000 votes for `Agaisnt` after Alice and Bob has finished voting.\n\nIf Alice was a transcoder, Bob will be simply reversing the votes they had delegated to Alice. However since Alice was a delegate, they never gained the voting power that was delegated to her.\n\nBob has effectively gained the ability to vote against somebody else's votes (without first actually increasing their voting power since they are not a transcoder) and can vote themselves, which allows them to manipulate governance.\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nThere should be a check that a delegate is a transcoder before subtracting the tally. Here is some pseudocode:\n\n```\nif (delegateVoter.hasVoted && ---delegate is transcoder ---)\n```\n\nThis is an edit of the conditional of the function `_handleOverrides`. This ensures that the subtraction of vote tally is only performed when the delegate is a voter AND the delegate is a transcoder. This should fix the accounting/subtraction issue of vote tally for non-transcoder delegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",

However, the `proposalSnapshot` function does not account for funding fees, which can cause an inflated total voting power compared to actual user-generated voting power.\n\nTo demonstrate this vulnerability, I generated a potential PoC by creating a scenario where a transcoder votes on a proposal with 100 tokens and its delegators vote on the same proposal with 100 tokens each. The delegators are set up to have different `delegateAt` timestamps than the transcoder's `proposalSnapshot` timestamp, which leads to a discrepancy in their deductions due to funding fees. This can cause the total voting power calculated by the contract to be incorrect and unachievable for users to reach unanimous decisions.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, I would recommend modifying the `proposalSnapshot` function to account for funding fees or using a different approach that calculates the correct total voting power based on actual user-generated voting power.",

Since they are not a transcoder, they don't have their votes initially increased by the amount delegated to them, voting weight is still subtracted from the tally of their vote choice.\n\nMaliciously, this could be used to effectively double one's voting power, by delegating their votes to a delegator who is about to vote for the choice which they don't want. It can also occur accidentally, for example when somebody delegates to a transcoder who later switches role to delegate.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen a user is not a transcoder, their votes are determined by the amount they have delegated to the delegatedAddress, and does not increase when a user delegates to them:\n\n```solidity\n        if (bond.bondedAmount == 0) {\n            amount = 0;\n        } else if (isTranscoder) {\n            amount = bond.delegatedAmount;\n        } else {\n            amount = delegatorCumulativeStakeAt(bond, _round);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nLets that this delegator (Alice) has 100 votes and votes `For`, Then another delegator(Bob) has delegated 1000 votes to Alice As stated above, Alice doesn't get the voting power of Bob's 1000 votes, so the `For` count increases by 100.\n\nBob now votes, and `_handleVotesOverrides` is called. In this function, the first conditional, `if isTranscoder` will return false as Bob is not self-delegating. \n\nThen, there is a check that the address Bob has delegated to has voted. Note that there is a missing check of whether the delegate address is a transcoder. Therefore the logic inside `if (delegateVoter.hasVoted)` is executed:\n\n'''solidity\n    if (delegateVoter.hasVoted) {\n            // this is a delegator overriding its delegated transcoder vote,\n            // we need to update the current totals to move the weight of\n            // the delegator vote to the right outcome.\n            VoteType delegateSupport = delegateVoter.support;\n\n            if (delegateSupport == VoteType.Against) {\n                _tally.againstVotes -= _weight;\n            } else if (delegateSupport == VoteType.For) {\n                _tally.forVotes -= _weight;\n            } else {\n                assert(delegateSupport == VoteType.Abstain);\n                _tally.abstainVotes -= _weight;\n            }\n        }\n'''\n\nThe logic reduces the tally of whatever choice Alice voted for by Bob's weight. Alice initially voted `For` with 100 votes, and then the For votes is reduced by Bob's `1000 votes`. Lets say that Bob votes `Against`. This will result in an aggregate 900 vote reduction in the `For` tally and +1000 votes for `Agaisnt` after Alice and Bob has finished voting.\n\nIf Alice was a transcoder, Bob will be simply reversing the votes they had delegated to Alice. However since Alice was a delegate, they never gained the voting power that was delegated to her.\n\nBob has effectively gained the ability to vote against somebody else's votes (without first actually increasing their voting power since they are not a transcoder) and can vote themselves, which allows them to manipulate governance.\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nThere should be a check that a delegate is a transcoder before subtracting the tally. Here is some pseudocode:\n\n```\nif (delegateVoter.hasVoted && ---delegate is transcoder ---)\n```\n\nThis is an edit of the conditional of the function `_handleOverrides`. This ensures that the subtraction of vote tally is only performed when the delegate is a voter AND the delegate is a transcoder. This should fix the accounting/subtraction issue of vote tally for non-transcoder delegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",
