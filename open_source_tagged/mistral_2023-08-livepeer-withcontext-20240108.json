Here is a gist of the POC:\n. Running the POC it shows that the current usage of `MathUtils` when calculating `treasuryRewards` will always cause an underflow in the next line of code.\n\n`updateTranscoderWithFees` is called every time a winning ticket is redeemed . Whenever the transcoder has skipped the previous round reward call, this function has to re-calculate the rewards, as documented in  This re-calculation will always fail due to the underflow shown above. \n### Impact\nThis will lead to accounting errors, unexpected behaviours and can cause a loss of winning tickets.\n\nFirstly, the accounting errors and unexpected behaviours: these are all the storage values getting updated in `updateTranscoderWithFees`:\n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol\n\nfunction updateTranscoderWithFees( address _transcoder,\n        uint256 _fees,\n        uint256 _round\n    ) external whenSystemNotPaused onlyTicketBroker {\n// ...\n// transcoder & earningsPool.data\nL314: Transcoder storage t = transcoders[_transcoder];\nL321: EarningsPool.Data storage earningsPool = t.earningsPoolPerRound[currentRound];\n\n//accounting updates happen here\nL377: t.cumulativeFees = t.cumulativeFees.add(transcoderRewardStakeFees)\n\t  .add(transcoderCommissionFees);\nL382: earningsPool.updateCumulativeFeeFactor(prevEarningsPool,delegatorsFees);\nL384: t.lastFeeRound = currentRound;\n```\n- Let `currentRound() - 1` be the previous round where the transcoder skipped the reward call\n- Let `currentRound()` be current round\n- Let `currentRound() + 1` be the next round\n\nDuring `currentRound()` it wont be possible to update the `Transcoder` storage or\n`earningsPool.data` storage because of the underflow that will happen because `currentRound() - 1` reward call has been skipped by the transcoder.\n\nDuring `currentRound() + 1` it will be possible to call `updateTranscoderWithFees`, however, L382 will only update the `prevEarningsPool`, which in this case will be `currentRound()`, not `currentRound - 1`. Therefor, the `EarningsPool.data.cumulativeRewardFactor` won't be updated for `currentRound() - 1`.\n\nLastly, the validity of a ticket is two rounds as per the . This means that a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` should be able to redeem it in `currentRound() - 1` and `currentRound()`. However, a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` wont be able to redeem it in `currentRound()` because of the underflow that happens while redeeming a winning ticket in `currentRound()`. The transcoder wont be able to redeem it after `currentRound + 1..N` because the ticket will be expired.\n## Tools Used\nManual Review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nUse `PreciseMathLib` instead of `MathLib`:\n```javascript\nfile: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol\n\nL355: \n- uint256 treasuryRewards = MathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);\n+ uint256 treasuryRewards = PreciseMathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nLibrary",

                "poc_patch": "Answer:\n\nYes, the given smart contract function is vulnerable to the type of vulnerability described.\n\nType of vulnerability: Incorrect conditional checks leading to unintended consequences\n\nReason:\n\nThe vulnerability exists due to the conditional check `if (prevEarningsPool.cumulativeRewardFactor == 0 && lastRewardRound == currentRound)` in the function. If this condition is true, the function calculates and updates the `prevEarningsPool.cumulativeRewardFactor`. However, this conditional check is not properly isolated, and the critical operation of updating `activeCumulativeRewards` is placed within the same if-statement. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as skipping the update of `activeCumulativeRewards` if the condition is not true.\n\nFor example, if the `prevEarningsPool.cumulativeRewardFactor` is not equal to 0 or the `lastRewardRound` is not equal to the `currentRound`, the `activeCumulativeRewards` will not be updated, which could lead to incorrect fee distribution and potential loss of funds.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, the developer should carefully analyze the control flow of the function and ensure that all important operations, such as updating `activeCumulativeRewards`, are performed despite the conditional restrictions. One possible solution is to separate the conditional check and the update of `activeCumulativeRewards` into two separate if-statements.\n\nHere's an example of how the code could be modified to fix the vulnerability:\n```scss\nif (currentRound > lastRewardRound) {\n   // ...\n\n   if (currentRound == lastRewardRound + 1) {\n       // If reward() has not been called yet in the current round, then the transcoder's activeCumulativeRewards has not\n       // yet been set in for the round.\n       activeCumulativeRewards = t.cumulativeRewards;\n   }\n\n   // ...\n}\n\n// Update prevEarningsPool.cumulativeRewardFactor if the condition is met\nif (prevEarningsPool.cumulativeRewardFactor == 0 && lastRewardRound == currentRound) {\n   // ...",

However, there is no check to ensure that the 'currentRound' is not the first round, which can cause an array index out of bounds error.\n\nIf 'currentRound' is the first round, then 'currentRound.sub(1)' will be equal to zero, which may not be a valid index in the 'earningsPoolPerRound' array. This can cause the smart contract to throw an exception, leading to potential losses for users and degradation of the system's reputation.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract function should check if 'currentRound' is not equal to zero before accessing the 'earningsPoolPerRound' array using 'currentRound.sub(1)'. For example, the smart contract function can add the following check before accessing the 'earningsPoolPerRound' array using 'currentRound.sub(1)':\n\nrequire(currentRound > 0, \"currentRound cannot be zero\");\n\nThis check will ensure that the smart contract function does not access the 'earningsPoolPerRound' array using an invalid index, thereby preventing the potential losses and degradation of the system's reputation.",

Since they are not a transcoder, they don't have their votes initially increased by the amount delegated to them, voting weight is still subtracted from the tally of their vote choice.\n\nMaliciously, this could be used to effectively double one's voting power, by delegating their votes to a delegator who is about to vote for the choice which they don't want. It can also occur accidentally, for example when somebody delegates to a transcoder who later switches role to delegate.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWhen a user is not a transcoder, their votes are determined by the amount they have delegated to the delegatedAddress, and does not increase when a user delegates to them:\n\n```solidity\n        if (bond.bondedAmount == 0) {\n            amount = 0;\n        } else if (isTranscoder) {\n            amount = bond.delegatedAmount;\n        } else {\n            amount = delegatorCumulativeStakeAt(bond, _round);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nLets that this delegator (Alice) has 100 votes and votes `For`, Then another delegator(Bob) has delegated 1000 votes to Alice As stated above, Alice doesn't get the voting power of Bob's 1000 votes, so the `For` count increases by 100.\n\nBob now votes, and `_handleVotesOverrides` is called. In this function, the first conditional, `if isTranscoder` will return false as Bob is not self-delegating. \n\nThen, there is a check that the address Bob has delegated to has voted. Note that there is a missing check of whether the delegate address is a transcoder. Therefore the logic inside `if (delegateVoter.hasVoted)` is executed:\n\n'''solidity\n    if (delegateVoter.hasVoted) {\n            // this is a delegator overriding its delegated transcoder vote,\n            // we need to update the current totals to move the weight of\n            // the delegator vote to the right outcome.\n            VoteType delegateSupport = delegateVoter.support;\n\n            if (delegateSupport == VoteType.Against) {\n                _tally.againstVotes -= _weight;\n            } else if (delegateSupport == VoteType.For) {\n                _tally.forVotes -= _weight;\n            } else {\n                assert(delegateSupport == VoteType.Abstain);\n                _tally.abstainVotes -= _weight;\n            }\n        }\n'''\n\nThe logic reduces the tally of whatever choice Alice voted for by Bob's weight. Alice initially voted `For` with 100 votes, and then the For votes is reduced by Bob's `1000 votes`. Lets say that Bob votes `Against`. This will result in an aggregate 900 vote reduction in the `For` tally and +1000 votes for `Agaisnt` after Alice and Bob has finished voting.\n\nIf Alice was a transcoder, Bob will be simply reversing the votes they had delegated to Alice. However since Alice was a delegate, they never gained the voting power that was delegated to her.\n\nBob has effectively gained the ability to vote against somebody else's votes (without first actually increasing their voting power since they are not a transcoder) and can vote themselves, which allows them to manipulate governance.\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nThere should be a check that a delegate is a transcoder before subtracting the tally. Here is some pseudocode:\n\n```\nif (delegateVoter.hasVoted && ---delegate is transcoder ---)\n```\n\nThis is an edit of the conditional of the function `_handleOverrides`. This ensures that the subtraction of vote tally is only performed when the delegate is a voter AND the delegate is a transcoder. This should fix the accounting/subtraction issue of vote tally for non-transcoder delegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",

Function summary: The `_handleVoteOverrides` function is responsible for handling vote overrides in a governance system. It calculates the weight of a voter (_account) and checks if the voter is a delegate or a delegator. If the voter is a delegate, it deducts the weight from any previous delegators for this delegate to make a vote. If the voter is a delegator, it adds a deduction to the delegated delegate, and updates the current totals if the delegator overrides its delegated delegate vote.\n2. No incorrect assumption: The smart contract code does not contain an incorrect assumption regarding reducing a non-existing previous delegate's votes. It correctly checks the delegation status of a voter and calculates the weight accordingly.\n3. Adjusted visibility and function access: The `votes()` function, which could potentially provide direct access to the delegation mapping, is not visible in the provided code. The `_handleVoteOverrides` function uses the `votes()` function internally, and it is not directly accessible from outside the contract.

However since Alice was a delegate, they never gained the voting power that was delegated to her.\n\nBob has effectively gained the ability to vote against somebody else's votes (without first actually increasing their voting power since they are not a transcoder) and can vote themselves, which allows them to manipulate governance.\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nThere should be a check that a delegate is a transcoder before subtracting the tally. Here is some pseudocode:\n\n```\nif (delegateVoter.hasVoted && ---delegate is transcoder ---)\n```\n\nThis is an edit of the conditional of the function `_handleOverrides`. This ensures that the subtraction of vote tally is only performed when the delegate is a voter AND the delegate is a transcoder. This should fix the accounting/subtraction issue of vote tally for non-transcoder delegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",
