If the specified token is X, the contract calculates `xf` as `xi + _applyFeeByRounding(specifiedAmount, feeDirection)`.\n2. If the specified token is Y, the contract calculates `yf` as `yi + _applyFeeByRounding(specifiedAmount, feeDirection)`.\n\nBy considering the fee in the final price points calculation, the contract ensures that the rewards calculation is accurate and fair.

The function uses clear and correct syntax for arithmetic operations, including power functions, multiplication, and divisions. There are no signs of incorrect function conversions or wrong arithmetic operations.\n\n2. The code is well-structured, with proper placement of expressions and clear naming conventions, reducing the likelihood of errors due to missing brackets or loop statements.\n\n3. The function uses custom functions like _applyFeeByRounding() and _getUtility() designed for specific operations and validations, which are appropriate and help prevent potential vulnerabilities.\n\nHowever, it is essential to evaluate the rest of the smart contract code and the implementation of the custom functions like _applyFeeByRounding() and _getUtility() to ensure the overall security of the system.",
