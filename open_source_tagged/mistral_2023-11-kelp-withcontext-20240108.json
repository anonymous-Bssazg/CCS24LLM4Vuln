These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied. The combination of deviations might be absolutely random, since it operates in set of rational numbers. But it will constantly open a small [+1%; +1.5%] arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.\n  \n## Proof on Concept\n* To reproduce the case described above, slightly change: \n  * `LRTOracleMock`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTOracleMock {\n        uint256 public price;\n\n\n        constructor(uint256 _price) {\n            price = _price;\n        }\n\n        function getAssetPrice(address) external view returns (uint256) {\n            return price;\n        }\n\n        function submitNewAssetPrice(uint256 _newPrice) external {\n            price = _newPrice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  * `setUp()`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTDepositPoolTest is BaseTest, RSETHTest {\n      LRTDepositPool public lrtDepositPool;\n\n        function setUp() public virtual override(RSETHTest, BaseTest) {\n            super.setUp();\n\n            // deploy LRTDepositPool\n            ProxyAdmin proxyAdmin = new ProxyAdmin();\n            LRTDepositPool contractImpl = new LRTDepositPool();\n            TransparentUpgradeableProxy contractProxy = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(\n                address(contractImpl),\n                address(proxyAdmin),\n                \"\"\n            );\n            \n            lrtDepositPool = LRTDepositPool(address(contractProxy));\n\n            // initialize RSETH.

If the oracle contract is manipulation-resistant and provides accurate and tamper-proof exchange rates, then the function should not be vulnerable to the attack described.\n\nTo further evaluate the potential vulnerability, we can consider how an attacker might attempt to manipulate the exchange rate. In the described attack, the attacker manipulates the exchange rate by selling a massive amount of foreign assets to the pool using a flash loan, making the pool believe that the native asset is incredibly valuable. However, in this smart contract code, the exchange rate is not determined by the pool's reserves and exchange rate mechanism, but rather by an oracle contract.\n\nTherefore, even if an attacker attempted to manipulate the pool's reserves and exchange rate using flash loans, it would not necessarily affect the exchange rate provided by the oracle contract. The oracle contract should be designed to provide a more accurate and tamper-proof exchange rate that cannot be easily manipulated by attackers.\n\nOf course, it's important to note that the security of the smart contract code ultimately depends on the security of the oracle contract and the accuracy of the exchange rates it provides.

These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied. The combination of deviations might be absolutely random, since it operates in set of rational numbers. But it will constantly open a small [+1%; +1.5%] arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.\n  \n## Proof on Concept\n* To reproduce the case described above, slightly change: \n  * `LRTOracleMock`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTOracleMock {\n        uint256 public price;\n\n\n        constructor(uint256 _price) {\n            price = _price;\n        }\n\n        function getAssetPrice(address) external view returns (uint256) {\n            return price;\n        }\n\n        function submitNewAssetPrice(uint256 _newPrice) external {\n            price = _newPrice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  * `setUp()`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTDepositPoolTest is BaseTest, RSETHTest {\n      LRTDepositPool public lrtDepositPool;\n\n        function setUp() public virtual override(RSETHTest, BaseTest) {\n            super.setUp();\n\n            // deploy LRTDepositPool\n            ProxyAdmin proxyAdmin = new ProxyAdmin();\n            LRTDepositPool contractImpl = new LRTDepositPool();\n            TransparentUpgradeableProxy contractProxy = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(\n                address(contractImpl),\n                address(proxyAdmin),\n                \"\"\n            );\n            \n            lrtDepositPool = LRTDepositPool(address(contractProxy));\n\n            // initialize RSETH.

These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied. The combination of deviations might be absolutely random, since it operates in set of rational numbers. But it will constantly open a small [+1%; +1.5%] arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.\n  \n## Proof on Concept\n* To reproduce the case described above, slightly change: \n  * `LRTOracleMock`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTOracleMock {\n        uint256 public price;\n\n\n        constructor(uint256 _price) {\n            price = _price;\n        }\n\n        function getAssetPrice(address) external view returns (uint256) {\n            return price;\n        }\n\n        function submitNewAssetPrice(uint256 _newPrice) external {\n            price = _newPrice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  * `setUp()`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTDepositPoolTest is BaseTest, RSETHTest {\n      LRTDepositPool public lrtDepositPool;\n\n        function setUp() public virtual override(RSETHTest, BaseTest) {\n            super.setUp();\n\n            // deploy LRTDepositPool\n            ProxyAdmin proxyAdmin = new ProxyAdmin();\n            LRTDepositPool contractImpl = new LRTDepositPool();\n            TransparentUpgradeableProxy contractProxy = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(\n                address(contractImpl),\n                address(proxyAdmin),\n                \"\"\n            );\n            \n            lrtDepositPool = LRTDepositPool(address(contractProxy));\n\n            // initialize RSETH.

Also, let's assume the `lrtOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)` returns 200, and the `lrtOracle.getRSETHPrice()` returns 1000.\n\nIn this scenario, the `rsethAmountToMint` would be calculated as follows:\n\n`rsethAmountToMint = (100 * 200) / 1000 = 20`\n\nAs we can see, the calculation is based on the actual exchange rates and does not involve any fixed calculations or incorrect conversions.

These deviations are significant enough to open an arbitrage opportunities which will impact an overall rsETH/ETH exchange rate badly. \n  \n* For a further analysis we have to look at the current LSD market distribution, which is represented here: \n\n|       \t|   **LSD**   \t| **Staked ETH** \t| **Market Share** \t| **LRTDepositPool ratio** \t|\n|-------\t|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------:\t|--------------------------\t|\n| **1** \t|     Lido    \t|      8.95m     \t|      ~77.35%     \t|          ~88.17%         \t|\n| **2** \t| Rocket Pool \t|      1.01m     \t|      ~8.76%      \t|          ~9.95%          \t|\n| **3** \t|  Coinbase   \t|     190.549    \t|      ~1.65%      \t|          ~1.88%          \t|\n\n\n* Where `LRTDepositPool ratio` is an approximate ratio of deposited lsts based on the overall LSD market. \n\n### An example of profitable arbitrage:\n* In order to find an absolute extrema, we have to first understand how rsETH/ETH price is calculted. Let's examine the following:\n    * $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}, \\; where \\quad totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(rETH) + Q''(stETH) + Q'''(cbETH)}{rsETHSupply}$$\n    * `Q(amount)` - is eth backed by amount of provided LSTs.\n\n* For a further calculation convenience, suppose `LRTDepositPool` has already some liquidity and it's distributed according to the LRTDepositPool ratio: \n  * $$ totalEthInPool = \\frac{Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88)}{(10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)rsETH}$$\n\n* Finally, let's consider all extremas of price feed deviations that are acceptable by chainlink nodes within a 24h period:\n  \n|       \t| **rETH/ETH** \t| **stETH/ETH** \t| **cbETH/ETH** \t|\n|-------\t|:------------:\t|:-------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\n| **1** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **2** \t|     -~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **3** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **4** \t|     -~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **5** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **6** \t|     +~2%     \t|     -~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n| **7** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      -~1%     \t|\n| **8** \t|     +~2%     \t|     +~0.5%    \t|      +~1%     \t|\n\n* In order to profit from such discrepancy, we have to maximize `rsethAmountToMint`:\n  * $$ rsethAmountToMint = \\frac{Q(amount)}{rsETHPrice}$$\n* To make it happen, we further have to minimize `rsETHPrice` or maximize Q`(amount)`. \n  * Let's first consider minimization of `rsETHPrice`:\n    *  $$ rsETHPrice = \\frac{totalEthInPool}{rsEthSupply}$$\n  * Which could be done, if we minimize `totalEthInPool`:\n    * $$ totalEthInPool = Q'(9.95) + Q''(88.17) + Q'''(1.88) => (10.85 + 88.08 + 1.98)eth ==> ~100.91eth$$\n  * And finally, the minimization of `totalEthInPool` comes from chainlink price feeds. Let's apply some of our acceptable price feed deviations to see, whether we can minimize `totalEthInPool` or not. \n    * `rETH/ETH` deviates by `+~2%`\n    * `stETH/ETH` deviates by `-~0.5%`\n    * `cbETH/ETH` deviates by `-~1%`\n  * where `'totalEthInPool` could be calculated as:\n    * $$ 'totalEthInPool = 1.02 * Q'(9.95) + 0.995 * Q''(88.17) + 0.99 * Q'''(1.88) => (11.06 + 87.64 + 1.96)eth ==> ~100.66eth$$\n* As we can see, we were able to increase nominator by 2% and the same time - decrease denominator by 0.3% if we supply rETH at specified acceptable deviations config, it will result in increased amount of rsETH shares minted just because of the price discrepancy:\n  * $$rsETHAmountToMint = \\frac{1.02 * Q(amount)}{ 0.997 * rsETHPrice}$$\n\n\n### Final words:\n* Basically, price feeds don't have to reach those extreme boundaries in order to profit from it. In theory presented above we where able to get +2.3% profit, which is significant in case there is a huge liquidity supplied. The combination of deviations might be absolutely random, since it operates in set of rational numbers. But it will constantly open a small [+1%; +1.5%] arbitrage opportunities to be exploited.\n  \n## Proof on Concept\n* To reproduce the case described above, slightly change: \n  * `LRTOracleMock`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTOracleMock {\n        uint256 public price;\n\n\n        constructor(uint256 _price) {\n            price = _price;\n        }\n\n        function getAssetPrice(address) external view returns (uint256) {\n            return price;\n        }\n\n        function submitNewAssetPrice(uint256 _newPrice) external {\n            price = _newPrice;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n  * `setUp()`:\n    * ```Solidity\n      contract LRTDepositPoolTest is BaseTest, RSETHTest {\n      LRTDepositPool public lrtDepositPool;\n\n        function setUp() public virtual override(RSETHTest, BaseTest) {\n            super.setUp();\n\n            // deploy LRTDepositPool\n            ProxyAdmin proxyAdmin = new ProxyAdmin();\n            LRTDepositPool contractImpl = new LRTDepositPool();\n            TransparentUpgradeableProxy contractProxy = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(\n                address(contractImpl),\n                address(proxyAdmin),\n                \"\"\n            );\n            \n            lrtDepositPool = LRTDepositPool(address(contractProxy));\n\n            // initialize RSETH.

The first staker can exploit this method to siphon funds from other users.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe mining amount of rsETH is calculated in function `getRsETHAmountToMint` which directly utilizes the total value of the asset divided by the price of a single rsETH.\n\n```solidity\n    function getRsETHAmountToMint(\n        address asset,\n        uint256 amount\n    )\n        public\n        view\n        override\n        returns (uint256 rsethAmountToMint)\n    {\n        // setup oracle contract\n        address lrtOracleAddress = lrtConfig.getContract(LRTConstants.LRT_ORACLE);\n        ILRTOracle lrtOracle = ILRTOracle(lrtOracleAddress);\n\n        // calculate rseth amount to mint based on asset amount and asset exchange rate\n        rsethAmountToMint = (amount * lrtOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)) / lrtOracle.getRSETHPrice();\n    }\n```\n\nSubsequently, the price of rsETH is related to its totalSupply and the total value of deposited assets.\n \n```solidity\n    function getRSETHPrice() external view returns (uint256 rsETHPrice) {\n        address rsETHTokenAddress = lrtConfig.rsETH();\n        uint256 rsEthSupply = IRSETH(rsETHTokenAddress).totalSupply();\n\n        if (rsEthSupply == 0) {\n            return 1 ether;\n        }\n\n        uint256 totalETHInPool;\n        address lrtDepositPoolAddr = lrtConfig.getContract(LRTConstants.LRT_DEPOSIT_POOL);\n\n        address[] memory supportedAssets = lrtConfig.getSupportedAssetList();\n        uint256 supportedAssetCount = supportedAssets.length;\n\n        for (uint16 asset_idx; asset_idx < supportedAssetCount;) {\n            address asset = supportedAssets[asset_idx];\n            uint256 assetER = getAssetPrice(asset);\n\n            uint256 totalAssetAmt = ILRTDepositPool(lrtDepositPoolAddr).getTotalAssetDeposits(asset);\n            totalETHInPool += totalAssetAmt * assetER;\n\n            unchecked {\n                ++asset_idx;\n            }\n        }\n//@audit the price of rsETH is calculated based on the asset and totalSupply\n        return totalETHInPool / rsEthSupply;\n    }\n```\n\nThe total value of deposited assets comprises three parts: the assets in `LRTDepositPool`, the assets in `NodeDelagator`, and the assets in the eigenlayer. Anyone can directly contribute asset tokens to `LRTDepositPool` or `NodeDelegator` to augment the total value of deposited assets.\n\n```solidity\n    function getAssetDistributionData(address asset)\n        public\n        view\n        override\n        onlySupportedAsset(asset)\n        returns (uint256 assetLyingInDepositPool, uint256 assetLyingInNDCs, uint256 assetStakedInEigenLayer)\n    {\n        // Question: is here the right place to have this? Could it be in LRTConfig?\n        assetLyingInDepositPool = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));\n\n        uint256 ndcsCount = nodeDelegatorQueue.length;\n        for (uint256 i; i < ndcsCount;) {\n            assetLyingInNDCs += IERC20(asset).balanceOf(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]);\n            assetStakedInEigenLayer += INodeDelegator(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]).getAssetBalance(asset);\n            unchecked {\n                ++i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Case\n\nTherefore, the price of rsETH is susceptible to manipulation by the first staker, considering the following scenario:\n\n- 1. Alice is the first staker and she deposits 1 USDC (the price of USDC is set to $1), she will get 1 wei rsETH, and the totalSupply of rsETH is 1 wei.\nHere is the test, add it to `test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol` and run with `forge test --match-test test_ControlPrice -vv`.\n```diff\ndiff --git a/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol b/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\nindex 40abc93..63349c2 100644\n--- a/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\n+++ b/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\n@@ -9,10 +9,11 @@ import { ILRTDepositPool } from \"src/interfaces/ILRTDepositPool.sol\";\n\n import { TransparentUpgradeableProxy } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol\";\n import { ProxyAdmin } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/ProxyAdmin.sol\";\n+import \"forge-std/console.sol\";\n\n contract LRTOracleMock {\n     function getAssetPrice(address) external pure returns (uint256) {\n-        return 1e18;\n+        return 1;\n     }\n\n     function getRSETHPrice() external pure returns (uint256) {\n@@ -109,6 +110,23 @@ contract LRTDepositPoolDepositAsset is LRTDepositPoolTest {\n         lrtDepositPool.depositAsset(rETHAddress, 2 ether);\n     }\n\n+    function test_ControlPrice() external {\n+        vm.startPrank(alice);\n+\n+        // alice balance of rsETH before deposit\n+        uint256 aliceBalanceBefore = rseth.balanceOf(address(alice));\n+\n+        rETH.approve(address(lrtDepositPool), 1 ether);\n+        lrtDepositPool.depositAsset(rETHAddress, 1 ether);\n+\n+        // alice balance of rsETH after deposit\n+        uint256 aliceBalanceAfter = rseth.balanceOf(address(alice));\n+        vm.stopPrank();\n+\n+        console.log(\" rsETH of Alice: \", aliceBalanceAfter - aliceBalanceBefore);\n+\n+    }\n+\n     function test_DepositAsset() external {\n         vm.startPrank(alice);\n```\n\n- 2. Alice donates 10000 USDC to the `LRTDepositPool` to inflate the price of rsETH. Now the price of rsETH is: (10000 + 1)ether / 1 wei = 10001 ether\n\n- 3. Any subsequent staker who deposits assets worth less than 10001 USDC will not receive any rsETH, and they won't be able to withdraw the deposited assets either.

The first staker can exploit this method to siphon funds from other users.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe mining amount of rsETH is calculated in function `getRsETHAmountToMint` which directly utilizes the total value of the asset divided by the price of a single rsETH.\n\n```solidity\n    function getRsETHAmountToMint(\n        address asset,\n        uint256 amount\n    )\n        public\n        view\n        override\n        returns (uint256 rsethAmountToMint)\n    {\n        // setup oracle contract\n        address lrtOracleAddress = lrtConfig.getContract(LRTConstants.LRT_ORACLE);\n        ILRTOracle lrtOracle = ILRTOracle(lrtOracleAddress);\n\n        // calculate rseth amount to mint based on asset amount and asset exchange rate\n        rsethAmountToMint = (amount * lrtOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)) / lrtOracle.getRSETHPrice();\n    }\n```\n\nSubsequently, the price of rsETH is related to its totalSupply and the total value of deposited assets.\n \n```solidity\n    function getRSETHPrice() external view returns (uint256 rsETHPrice) {\n        address rsETHTokenAddress = lrtConfig.rsETH();\n        uint256 rsEthSupply = IRSETH(rsETHTokenAddress).totalSupply();\n\n        if (rsEthSupply == 0) {\n            return 1 ether;\n        }\n\n        uint256 totalETHInPool;\n        address lrtDepositPoolAddr = lrtConfig.getContract(LRTConstants.LRT_DEPOSIT_POOL);\n\n        address[] memory supportedAssets = lrtConfig.getSupportedAssetList();\n        uint256 supportedAssetCount = supportedAssets.length;\n\n        for (uint16 asset_idx; asset_idx < supportedAssetCount;) {\n            address asset = supportedAssets[asset_idx];\n            uint256 assetER = getAssetPrice(asset);\n\n            uint256 totalAssetAmt = ILRTDepositPool(lrtDepositPoolAddr).getTotalAssetDeposits(asset);\n            totalETHInPool += totalAssetAmt * assetER;\n\n            unchecked {\n                ++asset_idx;\n            }\n        }\n//@audit the price of rsETH is calculated based on the asset and totalSupply\n        return totalETHInPool / rsEthSupply;\n    }\n```\n\nThe total value of deposited assets comprises three parts: the assets in `LRTDepositPool`, the assets in `NodeDelagator`, and the assets in the eigenlayer. Anyone can directly contribute asset tokens to `LRTDepositPool` or `NodeDelegator` to augment the total value of deposited assets.\n\n```solidity\n    function getAssetDistributionData(address asset)\n        public\n        view\n        override\n        onlySupportedAsset(asset)\n        returns (uint256 assetLyingInDepositPool, uint256 assetLyingInNDCs, uint256 assetStakedInEigenLayer)\n    {\n        // Question: is here the right place to have this? Could it be in LRTConfig?\n        assetLyingInDepositPool = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));\n\n        uint256 ndcsCount = nodeDelegatorQueue.length;\n        for (uint256 i; i < ndcsCount;) {\n            assetLyingInNDCs += IERC20(asset).balanceOf(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]);\n            assetStakedInEigenLayer += INodeDelegator(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]).getAssetBalance(asset);\n            unchecked {\n                ++i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Case\n\nTherefore, the price of rsETH is susceptible to manipulation by the first staker, considering the following scenario:\n\n- 1. Alice is the first staker and she deposits 1 USDC (the price of USDC is set to $1), she will get 1 wei rsETH, and the totalSupply of rsETH is 1 wei.\nHere is the test, add it to `test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol` and run with `forge test --match-test test_ControlPrice -vv`.\n```diff\ndiff --git a/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol b/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\nindex 40abc93..63349c2 100644\n--- a/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\n+++ b/test/LRTDepositPoolTest.t.sol\n@@ -9,10 +9,11 @@ import { ILRTDepositPool } from \"src/interfaces/ILRTDepositPool.sol\";\n\n import { TransparentUpgradeableProxy } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol\";\n import { ProxyAdmin } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/ProxyAdmin.sol\";\n+import \"forge-std/console.sol\";\n\n contract LRTOracleMock {\n     function getAssetPrice(address) external pure returns (uint256) {\n-        return 1e18;\n+        return 1;\n     }\n\n     function getRSETHPrice() external pure returns (uint256) {\n@@ -109,6 +110,23 @@ contract LRTDepositPoolDepositAsset is LRTDepositPoolTest {\n         lrtDepositPool.depositAsset(rETHAddress, 2 ether);\n     }\n\n+    function test_ControlPrice() external {\n+        vm.startPrank(alice);\n+\n+        // alice balance of rsETH before deposit\n+        uint256 aliceBalanceBefore = rseth.balanceOf(address(alice));\n+\n+        rETH.approve(address(lrtDepositPool), 1 ether);\n+        lrtDepositPool.depositAsset(rETHAddress, 1 ether);\n+\n+        // alice balance of rsETH after deposit\n+        uint256 aliceBalanceAfter = rseth.balanceOf(address(alice));\n+        vm.stopPrank();\n+\n+        console.log(\" rsETH of Alice: \", aliceBalanceAfter - aliceBalanceBefore);\n+\n+    }\n+\n     function test_DepositAsset() external {\n         vm.startPrank(alice);\n```\n\n- 2. Alice donates 10000 USDC to the `LRTDepositPool` to inflate the price of rsETH. Now the price of rsETH is: (10000 + 1)ether / 1 wei = 10001 ether\n\n- 3. Any subsequent staker who deposits assets worth less than 10001 USDC will not receive any rsETH, and they won't be able to withdraw the deposited assets either. Alice can directly siphon off these funds.\nFor example, if Bob deposit 10000 USDC, then the `rsethAmountToMint` is (10000 ether * 1) / (10001)ether = 0\n```\nrsethAmountToMint = (amount * lrtOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)) / lrtOracle.getRSETHPrice();\n```\n\nMoreover, there is no check on the actual amount of rsETH received by the user, and the execution continues even if this amount is zero.\n```\n    function _mintRsETH(address _asset, uint256 _amount) private returns (uint256 rsethAmountToMint) {\n        (rsethAmountToMint) = getRsETHAmountToMint(_asset, _amount);\n\n        address rsethToken = lrtConfig.rsETH();\n        // mint rseth for user\n        //@audit sender could receive 0 token\n        IRSETH(rsethToken).mint(msg.sender, rsethAmountToMint);\n    }\n```\n\n\n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual Review\n\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nIt is recommended to pre-mint some rsETH tokens to prevent price manipulation or ensure that the `rsethAmountToMint` is greater than zero.\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",
